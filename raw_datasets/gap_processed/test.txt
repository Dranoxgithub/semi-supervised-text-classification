False	The final character was Laura, the dumb brunette, a model unaware of her physical attractiveness. Laura was the key character around which most of the show's situations revolved. Her caption would change every episode and formed the title of the episode, such as ``and LAURA this week <bop>she<eop>'s on a diet'', ``This Week She Wants to Be a Singer'', ``This Week She Travels'', etc. The regular cast included Ken James as Mark, Gregory Ross as Bob, Gregory de Polnay as Jeremy, <bop>Jenee Welsh<eop> as Jennifer and Terry O'Neill as Tinto.
True	Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne sees David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive, she decides to let him stay because it reminded her of her own troubled childhood with her equally abusive father. Roseanne learns Darlene got an acceptance letter from the art school while David got rejected. At the end of the season, Roseanne fears Darlene will run away to school, although Darlene has already decided not to go. Realizing <bop>she<eop> was wrong, <bop>Roseanne<eop> persuades Darlene to not give up on her goals just to stay with David.
True	In 1987, coming up with ideas for new shows, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner of Carsey-Werner Productions decided to look into the concept of the working mother as a central voice. Up until that point, there had been shows with working mothers, but only as an adjunct to the father in the family. <bop>Werner<eop> had suggested that they take a chance on Barr whom they had seen on The Tonight Show. This was because <bop>he<eop> saw the unique ``in your face'' voice that they were looking for, and he contacted her agent and offered her the role.
False	In 1995 came the turn of playing Aurora, the central character in ``El beso de la mujer ara*a'', again under the direction of Harold Prince, who was a deciding factor when Argentine producers called him to lead the implementation of the Kiss ... in Buenos Aires, and he inquired about who would be the protagonist, Prince said: ``I love Valeria Lynch.''

False	Murphy was elevated to the eight-man leadership group for the 2007 season. In early 2007 Murphy replicated his good form of 2006, amassing 30 disposals against eventual premiers Geelong in Round 2. However, an injury to prime midfielder <bop>Nick Stevens<eop> after Round 3 saw Murphy attract the opposition's best taggers in most games. While <bop>his<eop> form remained solid, shaking the experienced taggers proved too big a challenge for the second year player and he finished outside the top 10 in the club's best and fairest.
False	She was also more opened about Olivia's decision to reveal her plan to Ian after only knowing him for less than a day. Kat Ward of Entertainment Weekly was more critical towards Olivia and Ian's friendship as she wrote ``I know that circumstances can make for strange friends, but <bop>Liv<eop> and Poor Ian get close very fast.'' <bop>She<eop> continued talking about Olivia's belief in Fitz's ability to save her writing ``Personally I think that Olivia's particular faith in her importance is more than a little overblown.
True	He fiddled with the dimensions of all the parts of his Luxo model--all but the bulb, since lightbulbs come from a store and don't grow, he reasoned--and he emerged with a second character, Luxo Jr. <bop>Lasseter<eop> initially intended the film as a plotless character study. When <bop>he<eop> showed some early tests at animation festival in Brussels, respected Belgian animator Raoul Servais exhorted him, ``No matter how short it is, it should have a beginning, a middle, and an end.
True	Jim Dawson devoted an entire chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged flatulence in Mind Meld, which he compares to the sound of someone stepping on a tribble. G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination. In <bop>his<eop> review of Mind Meld, <bop>Mike Clark<eop> of USA Today called the discussion between Shatner (left) and Nimoy (right) ``surprisingly frank''.
True	Shatner referred to The Original Series as ``cartoonish'' in Mind Meld, but later, upon questioning by a reporter, said, ``I never thought it was a cartoon ... I never thought it was beneath me.'' In a February 2002 interview on Larry King Live, <bop>Shatner<eop> said Mind Meld was similar to My Dinner with Andre, and indicated that <bop>he<eop> and Nimoy were hoping to produce more films of a similar nature.
True	Fatal Links draws exclusively on source evidence of letters and eye-witness reports and, while she was not privy to subsequent medical analysis of Beethoven's hair, her conclusions - that he showed symptoms of lead or arsenic poisoning - accord well with the result of the chemical analysis. In <bop>her<eop> second, and more substantial, biographical study of the composer, <bop>Altman<eop> investigates and refutes the claims of Maynard Solomon for the identification of the woman who Beethoven, in an undated letter found among his effects, referred to as his ``Immortal Beloved'' (Unsterbliche Geliebte), while building a thorough case--using Solomon's own criteria--for Anna-Marie Erd*dy as the putative recipient of the letter.

True	When Amelia visited the Emersons' dig in Amarna, however, Amelia found Radcliffe Emerson ill, and not only nursed him back to health, but also took over part of his duties. Grudgingly, he came to respect her abilities, and at the end, realized he was in love with her. In the later books Amelia refers to <bop>Emerson<eop> as ``the greatest Egyptologist of this or any other age.'' A few years after <bop>his<eop> marriage and Ramses's birth, Emerson tried to make peace with his mother.
False	In 2010, in an interview with French newspaper L'Equipe, former Milan captain Paolo Maldini stated that Gourcuff lacked discipline while at the club and often distanced himself from the team citing the player's refusal to learn the Italian language. <bop>Maldini<eop> also stated that Gourcuff did not give <bop>his<eop> all during his stint at Milan and that the player himself knew it.
False	The first topic that Madison addresses is the differentiation between a republic and a democracy. <bop>George Clinton<eop>, the Governor of New York and one of the foremost authors of the Anti-Federalist papers at the time of the ratification of the Constitution, cited Montesquieu, a political philosopher who authored ``The Spirit of the Laws'', to support <bop>his<eop> argument.

False	Captured, Elias realises he is responsible for the deaths of his entire community and begs the priest for forgiveness before his execution. The priests says he is unable to do so and curses Elias's bloodline. Elias escapes and becomes obsessed with the concept of atoning for his sin. He moves his remaining seven children to the desert where they begin to build a monument to <bop>God<eop>. As <bop>his<eop> children begin to die through illness and accident, Elias maintains that God has forsaken him and his religious beliefs turn from reverence to homicidal and take over his and his children's lives.
False	In 1984 Poovey published The proper lady and the woman writer: ideology as style in the works of Mary Wollstonecraft, <bop>Mary Shelley<eop>, and Jane Austen. <bop>Her<eop> book is based around the idea of a ``Proper Lady'' and she looks at the difficulties that these three important authors had in breaking free from this mould.

True	Jerome, and most of the Christian fathers, suppose that the reference is to Antiochus as the type of Antichrist, and that the description passes from the type to the antitype.

False	Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.

Wells in <bop>his<eop> A Short History of the World said in Chapter XLV ``The Development of Latin Christendom'': ``The Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands.

True	Burton, who was more interested in directing Ed Wood, later reflected he was taken aback by some of the focus group meetings for Batman Forever, a title which he hated. Producer Peter MacGregor-Scott represented the studio's aim in making a film for the MTV Generation with full merchandising appeal. Production went on fast track with Rene Russo cast as Dr. Chase Meridian but <bop>Michael Keaton<eop> decided not to reprise Batman because <bop>he<eop> did not like the new direction the film series was heading in.

True	Derek died from a heart attack during a road rage incident on Mavis's birthday in 1997. Derek Wilton was axed by producer Brian Park in a high-profile cull in 1997.

False	After leaving school she became a secretary and ``script girl'' for director Josef Von Sternberg. After clashing with Von Sternberg, White left his employment to work for Charlie Chaplin, who decided before long to place her in front of the camera.

False	Anthony Joseph Paul Cortese's Opposing Hate Speech suggests that Cissy is ``the archetypal stereotype for a lesbian...(using)...non-flattering stereotypes''. <bop>Alison Darren<eop>'s Lesbian Film Guide is much more positive, stating ``You Rang, M'Lord? gave us the wonderful Cissy (...replete with monacle and a series of beautifully tailored suits).'' <bop>She<eop> goes on to note the character's ``championing of the workers'' suggesting that throughout her character ``behaved with integrity and style.''

Other songs examine the album's themes from different angles: ``Plea from a Cat Named Virtute'' is written from the perspective of a depressed person's cat, ``One Great City!'' is about Samson's love--hate relationship with <bop>his<eop> hometown of Winnipeg, and ``Our Retired Explorer'' imagines a dinner date between philosopher <bop>Michel Foucault<eop> and a hopelessly nostalgic member of Ernest Shackleton's expedition to Antarctica.

False	Winthrop Sargeant, classical music critic at The New Yorker, compared the band's sound to the work of an ``impressionist composer with a great sense of aural poetry and a very fastidious feeling for tone color...

False	After recording his first album Georges went to London to seek new songs for his follow up disk.

False	Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin faulted the original edition, declaring that ``Too many s-f novels lack outstanding originality, but this one lacks it to an outstanding degree.'' F&SF reviewer Anthony Boucher found it to be ``intensely readable and unpredictably ingenious'' despite noticeable inconsistencies and its sometimes lack of scientific accuracy. Astounding Science-Fiction reviewer P. <bop>Schuyler Miller<eop> reported that, once Finney sets out <bop>his<eop> premise, the novel becomes ``a straight chase yarn, with several nice gimmicks and a not entirely convincing denouement.''

False	The rise of pretenders was not related to war or famine as neither appeared consistently with the pretenders.

Just as <bop>she<eop> is about to kill Frenchy, Fausto stops her, explaining that Satan's Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo are holding the Princess hostage, and will kill her should anything befall Frenchy.
False	Squeezit accomplishes this task, but has failed to include himself in the deal to rescue his friends, and the devil has him decapitated.

False	Curtis receives the unwelcome news from his Harley Street doctor that he has cancer. Later that day while watching television, Curtis sees acclaimed novelist Jonathan Stitch's acceptance speech for an award he gained at a prestigious book awards ceremony.

False	The Screaming Jets moved from their hometown Newcastle to Sydney's notorious Kings Cross district in early 1990, and recorded their debut album All For One in mostly midnight to dawn sessions at a local studio, after playing live shows seven nights a week.

False	Louis Althusser (1918--1990) and his colleagues, prominently including *tienne Balibar, reworked Marxism using insights from structuralism, against the so-called ``humanist'' trend in Sartrean and Western Marxisms. Althusser offered an influential new reading of <bop>Marx<eop>'s work, describing an ``epistemological break'' between the young, Hegelian Marx and the late Marx of Das Kapital. With <bop>his<eop> focus on the economic level and theory, Althusser came into conflict with social historians, such as E.P. Thompson.
True	His diary is an important source for the details of his career, as is his will, of 29 July 1576.

Winston Churchill, the British wartime Prime Minister, made an attack on the Irish Government and in particular *amon de Valera in his radio broadcast on VE Day. Churchill maintained that the British government displayed restraint on the Irish state while the de Valera government were allowed to ``frolic with the Germans''. Churchill maintained that the British could have invaded the Irish state but displayed ``considerable restraint'' in not doing so. <bop>De Valera<eop> replied to Churchill in a radio broadcast: Mr. Churchill makes it clear that in certain circumstances <bop>he<eop> would have violated our neutrality and that he would justify his action by Britain's necessity.

The Tecumseh Iron Company was organized in 1873 by Willard Warner, who was a brevet brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. <bop>Warner<eop> served on General Sherman's staff, so <bop>he<eop> named the furnace in his honor.

False	The arrival of the statue is known to have coincided with Amenhotep III's marriage with Tadukhepa, Tushratta 's daughter, in the pharaoh's 36th year; letter EA 23's arrival in Egypt is dated to ``regnal year 36, the fourth month of winter, day 1'' of his reign. Furthermore, <bop>Tushratta<eop> never mentions in EA 23 that the statue's dispatch was meant to heal Amenhotep from <bop>his<eop> maladies.
True	After manager Mark Stimson left Stevenage to join Gillingham, Julian refused to sign a new contract, stating he wanted to ``keep his options open for the summer''. As a result, he was transfer-listed in January 2008.

True	The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers. <bop>Robert Wise<eop> met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that <bop>he<eop> was not making a ``documentary or realistic movie'' about her family, and that he would make the film with ``complete dramatic freedom'' in order to produce a ``fine and moving film''--one they could all be proud of.
False	Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's ``romantic nonsense and sentiment'', the children's ``artificial roles'', and Robert Wise's ``cosy-cum-corny'' direction. <bop>Judith Crist<eop>, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as ``icky sticky'' and designed for ``the five to seven set and their mommies''. In <bop>her<eop> review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film ``the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat'', and that audiences have ``turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs''.
True	His grandson was Adam Walays who in turn had two sons, the eldest of whom succeeded to the family estates in Ayrshire.

False	The report quotes Brian Naranjo of the University of California, Los Angeles to the effect that neutron energy spectrum reported in the 2006 paper by Taleyarkhan, et al. was statistically inconsistent with neutrons produced by the proposed fusion reaction and instead highly consistent with neutrons produced by the radioactive decay of Californium 252, an isotope commonly used as a laboratory neutron source . The response of Taleyarkhan et al., published in Physical Review Letters, attempts to refute <bop>Naranjo<eop>'s hypothesis as to the cause of the neutrons detected. Tsoukalas, head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue, and several of <bop>his<eop> colleagues at Purdue, had convinced Taleyarkhan to move to Purdue and attempt a joint replication.
True	William M. Bugg, emeritus physics professor at the University of Tennessee also traveled to Taleyarkhan's lab to repeat the experiment with his equipment. He also reported neutron emission, using plastic neutron detectors. Taleyarkhan claimed these visits counted as independent replications by experts, but Forringer later recognized that he was not an expert, and <bop>Bugg<eop> later said that Taleyarkhan performed the experiments and <bop>he<eop> had only watched.
True	This information was instrumental in safety improvements within the manufacturing of aircraft engines, the development of military fighter canopies, and the creation of runway management plans. Laybourne's skills in forensic ornithology helped solve around 1,000 cases of bird-related airplane crashes a year.

True	In that job, which involved him in the early electrical recording process, he met Jay Wilbur (James Edward Wilbur), a dance bandleader who interested him in the technical side of recording. The company folded, and Wilkinson took a job in charge of the recorded music at an ice rink in Brighton. <bop>Wilbur<eop> had joined Crystalate, another record company, and invited Wilkinson to join <bop>him<eop> at its studios in Hampstead.
True	The midnight dash went one and a half blocks to Annie's Paramount Steak House where the racers ran upstairs for a shot of schnapps, then down the stairs and back down the street to JR's.

True	On February 13, 1933, Ecklund defeated Chick McBride in rounds two and three at the Bremerton Athletic Club and subsequently in Silverdale, Washington on February 23, 1933. <bop>Jack Kracken<eop> is best remembered as the first boxer defeated by Joe Louis on July 4, 1934 in the first round of a scheduled six-round bout at Bacon Casino on Chicago's South Side. Kracken was one of Chicago's top heavyweights at the time <bop>he<eop> fought Louis.
False	To add insult to injury, she reminds Josh about the job offer aloud to everyone, especially Clay. Even though Josh says he said no, the surrounding employees angrily ignore and shun him. Tracey reveals that she was given the same offer but explicitly rejected it where <bop>Josh<eop> kept it open. Feeling betrayed about what <bop>he<eop> heard from Carol, Clay rushes off with Savannah's emotionally unstable pimp Trina (Jillian Bell) to party elsewhere, though Trina is more interested in robbing Clay of his wealth that he is actually keeping on his person.
True	Clay ends up racing Trina's car towards an opening drawbridge, attempting to jump the gap, a feat he'd earlier mentioned to Josh. Josh drives <bop>Mary<eop>'s minivan alongside him, and tries to convince Clay not to jump, but he is still angered and heartbroken from Carol offering Josh the job, as much as remembering <bop>her<eop> insults.

True	Their deaths- triggered by Sinclair's fear-inducing henchman Scarecrone causing them to remember the mugging, driving them to flee Chill by running off their balcony- prompt Bruce to become Batman to investigate, Gordon having written their deaths off as an accident and Bruce unwilling to investigate himself because of the risk to his new wife, Julie Madison. In the Flashpoint event, an alternate timeline is created where among other massive changes, <bop>Thomas Wayne<eop> rather than Bruce appears as Batman. Details after the events of <bop>his<eop> son's death remains ambiguous, but Thomas is shown to have Joe Chill's gun in the Batcave's trophy display, suggesting Thomas got his revenge.
True	It notes that, ``the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience, (reflects) the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation''. Writing in the Financial Times, <bop>Philip Stephens<eop>, one of the panellists, later accused the BBC's director-general, Mark Thompson, of misrepresenting the panel's conclusions. <bop>He<eop> further opined ``My sense is that BBC news reporting has also lost a once iron-clad commitment to objectivity and a necessary respect for the democratic process.
True	Kelly was found dead, by suicide, in a field close to his home early on 18 July. An inquiry led by Lord Hutton was announced by the British government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to Kelly's death, concluding that ``Dr. Kelly took his own life.'' In <bop>his<eop> report on 28 January 2004, <bop>Lord Hutton<eop> concluded that Gilligan's original accusation was ``unfounded'' and the BBC's editorial and management processes were ``defective''.

False	Michael manages to make Harry see sense, but throws his gun into the river before he can cause any further damage. Inspector Yilmaz warns Harry to stay away from Fazouk and let the police continue with their investigation. Back in England, <bop>Joanna<eop> receives a postcard, seemingly from Olivia, stating that <bop>she<eop> is safe and well but need to get away for a while.
True	Meanwhile, Harry's son Michael (Gary Lucy) flies out to Istanbul to help with the search. Harry, deciding that Fazouk knows more than he is letting on, threatens him at gunpoint in front of a club full of paying customers. <bop>Michael<eop> manages to make Harry see sense, but throws <bop>his<eop> gun into the river before he can cause any further damage.
True	As unrest starts to unfold across the country, Harry and Joanna meet with a Kurdish woman who claims that Olivia gave her passport and plane ticket to her daughter as an act of kindness, to allow her to come to Britain to be with her husband and young daughter.

But when a call finally comes in with a lead on <bop>her<eop> whereabouts, are Harry and Joanna set to be re-united with their daughter, or has tragedy struck?
True	He closed out his career with 3,553 yards rushing and still ranks third on OSU's all-time rushing list, trailing only Heisman Trophy winners Archie Griffin (5,589) and Eddie George (3,768). <bop>Spencer<eop> shared time with Kevin Long as the starting running back with Chicago and rushed for 1157 yards on 300 carries with 6 touchdowns in <bop>his<eop> rookie season.
False	Dur*n tells his wife that he regrets letting them down and needs to go back in the ring in order to regain his popularity and the forgiveness of his fans. Due to this incident, Arcel is retired from his training and tells Dur*n that Plomo will be his coach. In June 1983, New York City, the day of <bop>his<eop> fight against <bop>Davey Moore<eop>, Leonard gratefully meets Dur*n for the first time since the rematch, saying that he forgives Dur*n.
False	Forever Changes, released in November 1967 and recorded and co-produced by Bruce Botnick is a suite of songs using acoustic guitars, strings, and horns that was recorded while the band was falling apart as the result of various substance abuse problems and tension between <bop>Arthur Lee<eop> and Bryan MacLean, who wanted more of <bop>his<eop> songs on the album.
True	Claude Rivi*re states that Fourneau is the opposite of being a fashionable painter: ``A great admirer of Antonin Artaud, of Paulhan, of Aragon, the artist calls upon his understanding of his model and goes beyond just a formal expression to impose his point of view.'' Jean Paulhan asks himself: ``By what secret, Jean-Claude Fourneau possesses such prolific fierceness?'' . <bop>Jean-Claude Fourneau<eop> appears on a photograph of surrealist artists gathered at the Caf* Cyrano in 1953, and Andr* Breton mentions <bop>him<eop> as being part of the group.

False	Although Curtis's involvement in the project was short-lived, Roundabout would eventually evolve into Deep Purple the following year. Chris Curtis choice of Bobby Darin's ``When I Come Home'' despite a strong band performance, was a relative chart failure by their standards, which to an extent undermined <bop>his<eop> position as song selector for the band thereafter, and some internal disagreements over musical policy/direction, that had been evident earlier when <bop>Tony Jackson<eop> left resurfaced, which probably further hindered the group's musical progression and very likely played a part in Curtis leaving in 1966.
False	With this and other subtle changes, such as using lactose in place of glucose, they were able to push up yields of penicillin to 20 units per ml. But their cooperation had become one-sided. Heatley noted that ``Moyer had begun not telling me what he was doing.'' <bop>Florey<eop> returned to Oxford that September, but Heatley stayed on in Peoria until December, then for the next six months <bop>he<eop> worked at Merck & Co.

False	The Bears had Jay Cutler, Caleb Hanie, and Dan LeFevour already on the roster. During the offseason, Chicago also picked up Todd Collins and Matt Gutierrez. Williams has not received any other invitations from professional teams.

True	release is the fact that NIS America has actually provided an English dub with the series, their first ever. That being said, they sure have done an amazing job with the English voice cast.

True	He comes back from US to find out what happened 2 years back. Aditi Sajwan portrays Nitya Mitra, the best friend and lover of Dev, Payal's Elder Sister. (Before facial plastic surgery) Kishwar Merchant portrays <bop>Raima Maheshwari<eop>, the best friend of Sakshi who has an extramarital relationship with <bop>her<eop> husband, Rajnath.
False	The MacKillop buildings have produced rental income for the college. Sister <bop>Anne Marie Power R.S.J.<eop> has said that Mary MacKillop (St Mary of the Cross) ``would have a smile of approval for this important educational venture which is doing so much for the Catholic youth of Rotorua - a place very dear to <bop>her<eop> heart for the care that was afforded her there in a time of failing health, and especially because it was she herself who initiated the founding of the first Catholic school in Rotorua.''
True	However, it does explain the reason why today's saint is often honored as a bishop. The monastery at Icanho (in East Anglia, but the exact site is disputed) was destroyed in Danish raids. It is said that when by the orders of Saint Aethelwold Botolph's body was disinterred for translation to the new abbey of Thorney, <bop>Adulf<eop>'s body was buried with it, and as it proved impossible to disentangle the bones, both were taken to Thorney, where the relics of Adulf remained. <bop>His<eop> feast day is 17 June, along with Botolph.
False	In 1767 she married John Damer, the son of Lord Milton, later the 1st Earl of Dorchester. The couple received an income of *5,000 from <bop>Lord Milton<eop>, and were left large fortunes by Milton and Henry Conway. They separated after seven years, and <bop>he<eop> committed suicide in 1776, leaving considerable debts.
False	A man named Talbot tells Captain Ockham that this is not acceptable. Talbot begins to question Sam about his interest in the Sunda Trench, but Sam tells him he's just looking to get away on a trip. Ockham asks why Talbot is questioning <bop>Sam<eop>, and Talbot responds that <bop>his<eop> employers know a great deal about Ockham and his crew and that they have too much at stake to risk any surprises.
False	His partner, Sonya was a flight attendant on Flight 815. Sonya was a flight attendant on Flight 815 and Sam's girlfriend. Oscar Talbot is a mysterious man who runs the Christiane I expedition. <bop>David Massingham<eop> and Tracey R are friends of Sam Thomas that gather information for <bop>him<eop>.
False	Harvey Weinstein, whose Miramax Films funded the film, said, ``It was the longest standing ovation I've seen in over 25 years''. On May 22, 2004, the film was awarded the Palme d'Or. It was the first documentary to win that award since <bop>Jacques Cousteau<eop>'s and Louis Malle's The Silent World in 1956. Just as <bop>his<eop> much publicized Oscar acceptance speech, Moore's speech in Cannes included some political statements:
True	His form was rewarded when he was voted on to the League of Ireland Premier Division Team for 2008, receiving 59% of the votes for the centre back position. After rejecting a new deal with the club, Burns reunited with former boss Sean Connor at Dundalk for the 2009 season. Prior to the start of the 2010 season, <bop>Burns<eop> had been training with Shamrock Rovers with the aim of joining them, but after the signing of Dan Murray Burns was not going to be offered a contract, so <bop>he<eop> re-signed for Dundalk and was named captain.
True	In fact, she arguably became the most popular Angel and had the most episodes centered on her. Petite and owning lots of ``va-voom'' , her blond e hair and proclivity toward bikini s didn't hurt, either. As her sister did before <bop>her<eop>, <bop>Kris<eop> tended to take the ``inside'' covers with Kelly while working on the case, while Sabrina took ``outside'' roles.
False	Fans have credited him for being very down-to-earth. In 1997, as the young Hammer and Way Deep started their music production career, a friend (Edward Adu Mensah) introduced them to Obrafour, a potential rapper with unusual singing abilities and after vigorous grooming from Hammer, <bop>his<eop> debut album produced by <bop>Hammer<eop> and Way Deep was released on the Home Base Record label owned by Daniel ``Masoul'' Adjei and was later managed by Noise Management, owned by Abraham Ohene Djan in August 1999.
False	He became the eleventh player to reach 1500 points, doing so on October 25, 2006, with an assist against the Washington Capitals, and the sixth to do so with one franchise. Gordie Howe, Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Raymond Bourque and <bop>Steve Yzerman<eop> are the others who have achieved this feat. On March 22, 2008, Sakic notched <bop>his<eop> 1,000th career assist against the Edmonton Oilers on a second period goal scored by Tyler Arnason.
True	The mulloway served at the restaurant is sourced from an aquafarm in Palmers Island, New South Wales. <bop>Simon Thomsen<eop> visited the restaurant in 2009 for the Sydney Morning Herald, writing that ``Quay could easily trade on its good looks - those harbour, Opera House and bridge views - but Gilmore is creating food as sublime and spectacular as the setting.'' <bop>He<eop> went on to describe Gilmore's cooking as a ``virtuoso'' performance.
False	Issei Futamata Rika Nozawa (** ** Nozawa Rika) One of Tarao's friends. Voiced by: Reiko Katsura Takeo (*** Takeo) One of Tarao's friends. Voiced by: Reiko Yamada <bop>Hiroshi Nakajima<eop> (** * Nakajima Hiroshi) Katsuo's best friend and <bop>his<eop> classmate.
False	After the fall of Martinique, the rest of the French West Indies, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent, fell to the British without a fight. On May 6, 1762, in reward for his actions in Martinique, Lieutenant Colonel <bop>John Campbell<eop> promoted Montgomery to captain and gave <bop>him<eop> command of one of the ten companies of the 17th Foot.
False	In 1685 he was elected bishop of Macerata and Tolentino, April 9, 1685, and later was appointed Nuncio in Cologne in 1696. Pope Innocent XII elevated him to the rank of cardinal in the consistory of 19 December 1698, and he became archbishop of Ferrara. <bop>He<eop> became Cardinal Secretary of State during the pontificate of <bop>Pope Clement XI. On Clement<eop>'s death, at the succeeding conclave of 1721, Paolucci was the strongest candidate to succeed, but was vetoed by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor as he considered him too close to the French.
True	Marshall is portrayed by Chadwick Boseman in a movie, Marshall, which revolves around the 1941 case of the State of Connecticut v. Joseph Spell. The movie was released October 2017. Marshall was married twice. He married <bop>Vivien ``Buster'' Burey<eop> in 1929. After <bop>her<eop> death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year.
False	Destined for the church at a very young age, Albert was made canon of Magdeburg Cathedral in 1392. Five years later, in 1396, the brothers Sigismund and Albert decided to settle on a formal division of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst. As ``<bop>Lord<eop> of K*then,'' Albert took possession of the town of K*then as <bop>his<eop> main residence and capital of his newly-created principality.
True	The most prominent among them was Melchior van Santvoort, who had married a Japanese women and with whom he begot a daughter. Not long after arriving in Dejima, Verstegen asked Santvoort's daughter to marry him. In 1635, he was appointed to the position of trader. On December 7 of that year, <bop>Verstegen<eop> wrote to Governor Antonie van Diemen that <bop>he<eop> had learned of some Japan's islands (at around the 37th parallel north) where almost everything was made of gold and silver.
False	She told that if she was elected, the country would ``head towards a common future'', including those that had been displaced from the south and had come from the Turkish mainland after 1974, and that ``the outdated mentality would become history''. Prime Minister *zkan Yorganc*o*lu, former president Mehmet Ali Talat and former prime minister Ferdi Sabit Soyer also spoke in the rally, and <bop>Talat<eop> claimed that they would win the election in the first round. During <bop>his<eop> campaign, *zersay promised that if elected president, he would not only follow an active diplomatic policy in the negotiations, but also combat the ``rife partisanship and nepotism'' in politics, which he claimed was a role neglected using the peace process as a pretext.
False	Willie Ryan, who was named team captain at the start of the season, had to make do with a place on the substitutes bench. Goalkeeper Brendan Cummins, full-forward Eoin Kelly and right-corner forward Lar Corbett were the only survivors from the last Tipperary team to play in an All-Ireland final in 2001. Kilkenny manager Brian Cody in naming <bop>his<eop> team, omitted 2008 All-Ireland-winning captain <bop>James ``Cha'' Fitzpatrick<eop> for the final in favour of Derek Lyng.
False	Printz established the Belles Celebrity Answering Service in 1956, the same year the Broadway play opened, getting up at 4 a.m. in order to be able to arrive at the switchboard to make wake up calls that started as early as 5 a.m. There, Printz provided her customers with services that went beyond messages. Starting with <bop>Hermione Gingold<eop>, who was on the calling end of Printz's first message, <bop>her<eop> clients included Candice Bergen, Shirley MacLaine, Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, Brooke Shields, Liz Smith, Spencer Tracy, Kathleen Turner, Tennessee Williams, as well as members of the band Kiss.
False	In addition to the title track, she had two more hit singles, ``Honey For The Bees'' (#24 R&B and #6 Dance) and ``The Heat of Heat''. Produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, noted for their later work with <bop>Janet Jackson<eop>, the latter track returned Austin to the top 15 of the R&B charts for what would be the last time to date. It would also be <bop>her<eop> last Hot 100 charting to date, although she would score a top-5 dance hit with the single Reach that appeared originally on her 1994 CD That Secret Place.
True	With their leadership gone, the two Camorra gangs disappeared and D'Aquila and the Schiro family in Brooklyn took over many of their rackets in Brooklyn. Soon after, D'Aquila absorbed the Mineo gang, making Mineo his first lieutenant. D'Aquila now controlled the largest and most influential Italian gang in New York City. It was about this time that <bop>Joe Masseria<eop>, another former Morello captain, began asserting <bop>his<eop> influence over the Lower East Side's Little Italy and began to come into conflict with D'Aquila's operations there, as Prohibition approached.
True	Second World War ace, Wing Commander John Baldwin, Squadron Leader Harbison, and two junior officers were selected for this task. Harbison's specific assignment was with the USAF 4th Fighter Group to evaluate combat tactics used by the F-86 against the Soviet MiG-15. On 13 February 1952, <bop>Harbison<eop> reported to Colonel Harrison Thyng, commander of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Kimpo Air Base, South Korea where <bop>he<eop> was assigned to the 335th Fighter Squadron.
True	Since 1992, Allen has worked regularly, primarily in guest or recurring roles on various television series. These include Doogie Howser, M.D. and Silk Stalkings. Allen also had a recurring role in the T.V. series Bull playing the character Pam Boyd. <bop>Allen<eop> won the recurring role of Amy Madison on Buffy the Vampire Slayer for the season one episode ``Witch''. <bop>She<eop> returned as Amy in the second season's ``Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered'', the season three episode ``Gingerbread'' (where her character was turned into a rat) and season four's ``Something Blue'' (in a brief, non-speaking cameo).
False	An important political figure, Giuseppe Spataro, was born in Vasto, on 12 June 1897. His parents, Anna and <bop>Alfonso Nasci<eop>, were a high-class Italian family, living in the urban center within the province Chieti. After studying in <bop>his<eop> birth city of Vasto, Spataro transferred to a boarding school called Montecassino in 1908, the adjustment to this new life made easier by the death of his father in 1910.
False	In Daniel's absence, however, Henrik enjoyed a high-scoring start to the season. On 14 November 2009, he scored his first NHL career hat-trick in an 8--2 win against the Colorado Avalanche. Leading up to <bop>Daniel<eop>'s 22 November return, Henrik scored seven goals in seven games. <bop>He<eop> continued his pace into December, recording a League-leading 25 points (five goals, 20 assists) in 15 games to be named the NHL's First Star of the Month.
False	``The Resurrection of Lady Lester'' by OyamO (Charles F. Gordon) is a play and published book depicting Young's life; subtitled ``A Poetic Mood Song Based on the Legend of Lester Young''. In the 1986 film Round Midnight, the fictional main character Dale Turner, played by <bop>Dexter Gordon<eop>, was partly based on Young - incorporating flashback references to <bop>his<eop> army experiences, and loosely depicting his time in Paris and his return to New York just before his death.
True	In 1971, he published two volumes on the organic chemistry of palladium which were ``widely recognised as the most authoritative account of the organo-complexes of this metal''. <bop>Maitlis<eop> was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1984. The citation highlights <bop>his<eop> work on the platinum group metals palladium, rhodium and iridium.
False	For four years following this Machiavellian political move, in effect the nation's first coup d'*tat, Flores continued to wield considerable power behind the scenes as commander of the military. President Rocafuerte's most lasting contribution was to begin development of a public school system. Although <bop>he<eop> had previously condemned <bop>Flores<eop>'s violations of civil liberties, Rocafuerte argued that ``the backwardness of Ecuador makes enlightened despotism necessary.''
True	Smith shared outfield duties with Geissinger, Satterfield and Wisniewski, hitting .196 in 46 games while going 1-2 as a reliever. Grand Rapids advanced to the playoffs, but was swept by the South Bend Blue Sox in the best-of-three series on strong pitching by Jean Faut. <bop>Smith<eop> had a solid season in 1953, hitting .227 with 73 stolen bases and a .343 OBP in a career-high 114 games, being surpassed only by Fort Wayne's Betty Foss for the most stolen bases (80). <bop>She<eop> also posted career numbers in hits (91), runs (86), doubles (20), triples (5) and steals, while walking 71 times and tying for third in doubles.
True	Peaking at #27 in Canada's Alternative Rock chart in April 2013, the song 'Weird Science' by Toronto-based electro cock-rock band Most Non Heinous was co-written by Parsons. In the summer of 2012, Kebab was featured on the track Livin' Tonight by fellow Canadian modern rock act illScarlett. <bop>Parsons<eop> provided some production work to Elise LeGrow on <bop>her<eop> song 'Weed and Wine'.
False	When Murray broke his shoulder on the eve of Wolves' Championship play-off semi-final first leg against local rivals West Bromwich Albion, Hennessey stepped in to make his Wolves debut. With <bop>Murray<eop> sidelined for the whole of the 2007--08 season with yet another injury, Hennessey became firmly established at the club's number one, being an ever-present in the league. The season also saw <bop>him<eop> sign a new deal which will keep him at Molineux until Summer 2012.
False	This last show incarnation ended on November 19, 2010, when <bop>Ed Lover<eop> was released from the station and Mallette was reassigned to the midday shift, replacing De Ja. Troi Torain (born May 3, 1964), who previously worked at Power 105's rival hip-hop station WQHT with <bop>his<eop> half-brother Timothy Joseph (born January 3, 1979) who took Torain's old stage name ``Buc Wild'' until he switched to Power 105, is known as ``Star'' from the Star & Buc Wild morning show.
True	Baazi (Hindi: *****, Urdu: ****) is a 1984 Bollywood film directed by Raj N. Sippy. The film stars Dharmendra, Rekha, Mithun Chakraborty, Ranjeeta, Shakti Kapoor, Madan Puri and Mac Mohan. Ajay Sharma (<bop>Dharmendra<eop>), is a Police Inspector of notable wealth. <bop>He<eop> is happily married to Asha (Rekha) with two children.
False	Her police officer husband, good-natured Buddy, investigating the rumors of gay sex and drugs at the Watch with his partner Stan, is distracted by his burgeoning love affair with former high school classmate Sandra Anderson. Sandra just got back to the island and re-opened a coffee shop, her bad reputation as a promiscuous woman a painful fact in her life. <bop>Sandra<eop>'s teenaged daughter Emily resentfully observes <bop>her<eop> mother's doings; she's hoping for a serious romance different from her mom's history, but her boyfriend may have more basic intentions.
True	Hardy and Bo team up and discover ways of profiting off of the wayward teens at school with deep pockets and even heavier issues. The unlikely duo's new business takes a unique turn when the students learn that Bo has more to offer than what meets the eye as the characters get tossed headfirst into the lifestyles of the rich and dysfunctional. <bop>Hardy<eop> fights to save Walter and fix <bop>his<eop> broken family while Bo's past comes back to haunt her.
False	The main catalyzer of the movement for national Jewish music, however, was Joel Engel. Engel, composer and music critic, was born outside the Pale of Jewish settlement, and was a completely assimilated Russian. A meeting with the Russian nationalist critic <bop>Vladimir Stasov<eop> inspired Engel to seek <bop>his<eop> Jewish roots.
True	The elite social group in Kenya known as the Happy Valley set was notorious for stories of drug use and promiscuous sexual encounters. These expatriates living in British East Africa received much publicity for their decadent hedonism. While <bop>Idina<eop> was married to Josslyn Hay, they frequented the Muthaiga Country Club in Nairobi. At Clouds, <bop>her<eop> house above the Rift Valley, Idina hosted wild all-night parties where patrons enjoyed champagne, cocaine, and wife-swapping.
False	Nelson specializes in rubber-faced comedy characters, much as Red Skelton did in his heyday. His most popular originals include Jiffy Jeff, a punchy prizefighter; Eppy Eppeman, a know-it-all geek with thick eyeglasses; an unnamed dumb football player; Wilby Stuckinsin, a hillbilly chicken farmer based on a life experience of <bop>Nelson<eop>'s in Shreveport, Louisiana; and Mr. Pingyah, an argumentative Asian man who is more eloquent than the people <bop>he<eop> argues with.
True	He distinguished levels of logical reasoning, and introduced the notion of metalogic. Vasiliev spent 1912-13 in Western Europe (mostly Germany) and published his salient works ``Logic and Metalogic'' and ``Imaginary (non-Aristotelian) logic''. <bop>Vasiliev<eop> constructed non-Aristotelian logic using the concepts, and even the manner of reasoning, common to Aristotelian logic. <bop>He<eop> was aware of the achievement in mathematical logic (and even carefully studied Ernst Schr*der 's works) but did not make an attempt to formalise ``imaginary'' logic.
False	Though Blaisedell at first manages to assert his authority with his stolid demeanor and expert gunmanship, Abe McQuown and his troublesome gang of cowboys seek to antagonize him. One of <bop>McQuown<eop>'s former associates, John ``Bud'' Gannon, hopes to repent for the horrors of <bop>his<eop> past by becoming a deputy sheriff in Warlock, while his younger brother Billy continues to ride with McQuown.
True	Some long games, such as Bannochburn Legacy, had more than 500 lines of code. To illustrate the style of these compendiums, here is the Table of Contents from Hartnell's Giant Book of Computer Games http://www.devili.iki.fi/library/publication/119.en.html: * <bop>Hartnell<eop> also wrote several how-to books about various genres of computer games, including Giant Book of Spectrum Games published in 1983, and also edited others, including Pete Shaw 's Creating Adventure Games On Your ZX Spectrum, also published in 1983. They were designed so that a beginner could, using <bop>his<eop> programs as examples, intuitively learn the BASIC programming language.
False	For the first time in its ten-year history, MoveOn.org endorsed a Presidential candidate when Obama received 70 percent of an online ballot the organization held of its members. On February 3, 2008, another member from the <bop>Kennedy<eop> family, First Lady of California Maria Shriver, announced <bop>her<eop> endorsement for Obama.
True	Sen. Clinton's campaign fired at least two campaign volunteers for forwarding related e-mails about Obama. Obama's campaign organization responded with a letter from Christian leaders vouching for his Christian faith, as well as with appeals to supporters to help correct any misunderstanding. From November 2007 to January 2008, as part of a drive to promote awareness of <bop>his<eop> Christian faith, <bop>Obama<eop> gave interviews to Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, to Christianity Today and to the religious website Beliefnet.com.
False	Both Wilde and Hopkins were deeply influenced by Pater's work. Wilde wrote of pederastic and homoerotic culture -- though not in the ``elevated'' pederastic sense that it held for Pater and Hopkins -- in a number of works. And though ``Hopkins often was, it must be admitted, strikingly Ruskinian in <bop>his<eop> love of Aristotelian particulars and their arrangements ... , it was at the foot of <bop>Pater<eop> -- the foremost Victorian unifier of 'eros, pedagogy, and aesthetics' -- that Hopkins would ever remain.''
False	Coghill spoke of Miranda's sudden change in character during an interview with Inside Soap stating that she felt Steve was always Miranda's rebound after the breakdown of her and Dean's romance. <bop>Coghill<eop> felt the plot had dug up old history for the pair and also noted it as the point Miranda finally comes to a decision to live <bop>her<eop> life freely, stating: ``Miranda's hesitant at first, but comes to realise she only has one life to live, and it's time for her to live it.''
True	Alison Kirbe is a young London girl who has just found out she has inherited a Texas ranch from an old soldier she had befriended during World War II. Mistakenly assuming she is now the owner of a small empire, she crosses the Atlantic Ocean by ship. On her way, she meets <bop>Terence Keath<eop>, a fellow passenger heavily in debt to casino owner Lucky Reilly. To pay off <bop>his<eop> debts, he attempts to marry rich and starts to seduce Alison, as he thinks she is a wealthy heiress.

False	It was also notable for the first known compositions by member Nona Hendryx, who co-wrote with LaBelle, the socially conscious ``Shades of Difference''. The album's first single, the sexually charged, ``Morning Much Better'' was co-written by future disco hit-maker Michael Zager. In the same year <bop>Labelle<eop> was produced, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff hired the group to partake in backing up Laura Nyro on <bop>her<eop> acclaimed covers album, Gonna Take a Miracle.
False	They probably all contributed as a team to some of the larger commissions later attributed to his brother Francesco Guardi. His sister Maria Cecilia married the pre-eminent Veneto-European painter of his epoch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. He may have received his artistic training in Vienna, where he is first recorded in 1719, but had established a workshop in Venice by 1730. Among <bop>his<eop> first important clients was the connoisseur and collector <bop>Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg<eop>, for whom Guardi created numerous paintings with an Orientalist theme.
True	<bop>Roger Lambrecht<eop> (1 January 1916 in Sint-Joris-ten-Distel Belgium -- 4 August 1979 in Saint Pol de Leon, France) is a former Belgian professional road bicycle racer. <bop>He<eop> was professional from 1945 to 1954 where he won 18 races which included two stage wins in the 1948 and 1949 Tour de France as well as wearing the maillot jaune for two stages in 1948 and one stage in 1949.
False	``She spills coffee on herself with Cole, and then Todd, my dad, walks in on the two of them. Something innocent gets blown out of proportion, and then when Marty's pushed down the stairs, Cole automatically thinks it's Todd. It's been upsetting for Starr.'' Carlivati stated Hannah as being a ``real problem.'' Cole's incarceration for <bop>his<eop> brutal attack on ``<bop>Todd<eop>'' allows for the introduction of another love interest, James (Nic Robuck), the younger brother of Robert Ford (David A.
False	Later decided, for health reasons, to emigrate to Port Phillip.

The earliest were published in <bop>her<eop> mid-twenties: Grandma's Beach Surprise by Ilka List (G.P. Putnam's Sons) in 1975 and four including an edition of The Little Engine That Could in 1976.
True	Legs to Make Us Longer is the second album by American guitarist Kaki King, released in 2004 (see 2004 in music). The songs ``Frame'' and ``Doing the Wrong Thing'' were featured in the film Into the Wild (2007). In <bop>his<eop> review for Allmusic, critic <bop>Thom Jurek<eop> summarized that ``King is a major talent, an iconoclastic figure who is this era's only new voice on the acoustic guitar, even as she explores other compelling sonic and musical avenues.''
False	Additional songwriters include Hristodoulos Siganos and Valentino with ``Glyko Koritsi'' and Giorgos Papadopoulos with ``Giati'', while singer--songwriter s have also contributed, including Greek rock musician Kostas Tournas with ``Proti Mou Fora'' and Grigoris Petrakos with ``Kathe Proi''.

By the early twentieth century, some seventy years after <bop>his<eop> death, one biographer noted that more of <bop>Josiah Conder<eop>'s hymns were in common use in Britain and the USA, than those of any other Congregational author except for the great Dr Isaac Watts and his friend Doddridge.
False	Paris regards them as looking weird. The contestants must then style themselves for the first ever Miss Paris Pageant. After each contestant presents themself to Paris Hilton and guest star Santino Rice, Paris puts Nicole, Katie, and Kristen up for elimination, along with Desirae. <bop>She<eop> then says TTYN to <bop>Katie<eop> and Kristen, and Katie shows her true colors, swearing at Paris and saying she's ``not as nice as everyone thinks (she) is''.
True	Hauk takes over his shows, but his corny humor and the polka music he plays lead to a flood of letters and phone calls demanding that Cronauer be put back on the air. In the meantime, Cronauer spends his time drinking and pursuing Trinh, only to be repeatedly rebuffed. At the radio station, Taylor intervenes on <bop>Cronauer<eop>'s behalf, ordering Hauk to reinstate <bop>him<eop>, but Cronauer refuses to go back to work.

False	He recorded his best match figures of 10 for 152 against Kerala in the 1995-96 Ranji Trophy season. This brought him into national reckoning and he made his debut against Australia in the one-off Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla in 1996. India were without <bop>Javagal Srinath<eop>, having sustained an injury, and Johnson was drafted into the squad. <bop>He<eop> bowled in tandem with his Karnataka team-mate Venkatesh Prasad and picked up the wicket of Michael Slater in the second innings.
False	Allied with reporter Arturo Rodriguez, Black Mask begins a campaign to discredit Batman; while Rodriguez slams Batman in the press, Black Mask commits a series of murders disguised as the Dark Knight. The real <bop>Batman<eop> eventually exposes Rodriguez and captures Black Mask, but the crime lord kills the escorting officer transporting <bop>him<eop> to jail and escapes again.
False	Desperate, Roman had the staff chemists create a product that was rushed to the market without proper testing, disfiguring several hundred women. Circe, now Roman's fianc*e, then broke up with him in front of his entire staff. Bruce Wayne, now the head of Wayne Enterprises, offered to bail Janus Cosmetics out on the condition that <bop>Roman<eop> gave up control and allowed Wayne to appoint <bop>his<eop> own Board of Directors.
False	Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936.

Beckham was born at Wickland, near Bardstown in Nelson County, Kentucky, son of <bop>William Netherton<eop> and Julia Tevis (Wickliffe) Beckham. <bop>His<eop> maternal grandfather, Charles A.

False	Peter Thompson died in Hot Springs, South Dakota, and was interred in the West Lead Cemetery in Lead, South Dakota.

True	In around 1775--6, he painted the Portrait of Omai with Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, one of his most celebrated works. In 1779 Parry's wife Elizabeth (n*e Keene) died in childbirth. In 1789 <bop>Parry<eop> returned to Italy, according to James Northcote, ``to seek employment in art, in addition to the wish of stifling the regret for the loss of an amiable wife''. After a sudden decline in <bop>his<eop> health, he returned to London, where he died in 1791, aged 47.
True	The company's major UK trade marks were BRADES and WHS, but they had many others, some of which, such as Eagle, Giraffe and Pagoda, were only used on tools made for export. The WHS pointing trowel is prized amongst archaeologists in the United Kingdom who find its strength useful in digging heavy deposits. In <bop>his<eop> 1946 book Field Archaeology, <bop>Richard J. C. Atkinson<eop> (best known for excavating Stonehenge), ``unequivocally'' recommended the use of a trowel for archaeology; during the postwar era, WHS and a competing brand from Bowden were predominant.

False	According to Houbraken he was the most famous pupil of his father, the architect and poet Salomon de Bray. Houbraken called Jan the ``pearl in Haarlem's crown''. Houbraken saw a painting by de <bop>Bray<eop> of David and the Return of the Ark of the Covenant in the collection of Arnold van Halen in Amsterdam, dated 1697, that <bop>he<eop> admired for its realistic flesh tones in the forms of David playing the harp and the Levite s behind him.

Syvertsen remained with the band until April of that year when he left and was replaced by Olaf Olsen. Bassist <bop>Tresselt<eop> left the band in August 1999 and was succeeded by Nikolai Eilertsen. Greni sold <bop>his<eop> Vespa to pay the final installment to finance the production of Electric Psalmbook recorded during 1998 in Athletic Sound Studio in Halden, and released on the own label Grand Sport in March 1999.
False	Chapter 2, ``Once Were Wetlands'' drew on 19th century books and maps owned by the Twycross family and an article from the Victorian Historical Journal of 1940 that featured the natural history of the Arthur's Seat area as recalled by George Gordon McCrae in the latter part of his life. John William Twycross was also part of an extraordinary group of first cousins, <bop>William Scoresby Routledge<eop>, anthropologist, Easter Island, John Milne inventor of the modern seismograph, and <bop>his<eop> sister Lilian Twycross, Melbourne opera singer and the first student of F.

False	A Nazirite (******) was an Israelite who had taken special vows of dedication to Yahweh whereby he abstained for a specified period of time from using alcohol and grape products, cutting his hair, and approaching corpses. At the end of the period he was required to immerse himself in water. Thus the baptism of Jesus (Matthew 3:13-15) by <bop>John the Baptist<eop> could have been done ``to fulfil all righteousness'' at the ending of a nazirite vow. Following <bop>his<eop> baptism, the gospels give no reason to suppose Jesus took another nazirite vow until The Last Supper, (see Mark 14:25).
False	Although Katie recovered, they decided to keep the events of that night a secret to everyone, especially Bridget. Nick, deciding that he wanted another chance with Bridget, proposed to her. Despite her original hesitation, she accepted.

False	Longley's account of this murder differs from that of his later killings, where he was more inclined to brag about shooting men than to try to divert blame to others. Some versions of Green's killing claim he was a member of the Texas State Police; the TSP only existed from 1870 to 1873. Longley drifted around Texas for a time, and while gambling in saloons <bop>he<eop> became acquainted with noted gambler, <bop>Phil Coe<eop> In 1869, Longley and his brother-in-law, John Wilson, embarked on a crime spree through southern Texas.
True	The critic Kenneth Tynan was present when the scene was shot:``Francesca does it very sportingly and with no fuss ... though of course the set is closed, great curtains are drawn around the acting area ... and the wardrobe mistress rushes to cover Francesca with a dressing gown the instant Roman says, 'Cut'.'' <bop>Annis<eop> continued to be a leading television actress throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, appearing in series such as Edward the Seventh as Lillie Langtry, a role <bop>she<eop> starred in with Lillie;

True	The torture stops when Clayton is about to give up identities of people associated with the farm. The program trainees have seen the torture exercise Clayton was subjected to on closed-circuit television. The trainees are cautioned that the lesson to be learned from it is that they should not be caught.

False	In the texts of court historians of the Delhi Sultanate, and later the Mughal Empire, cow slaughter taboo in India is mentioned, as well as cow slaughter as a means of political message, desecration, as well as its prohibition by Sultans and <bop>Muslim Emperors<eop> as a means of accommodation of public sentiments in the Indian subcontinent. In 1756--57, in what was <bop>his<eop> fourth invasion of India, the founder of the Durrani Empire, Ahmad Sh*h Durr*n* sacked Delhi and plundered Agra, Mathura, and Vrndavana.
False	At the end of the strike, she could still organise more than 2,000 miners' wives to rally at Chesterfield football ground to demand help for the thousands of families left deprived, some penniless, by the dispute.

True	Henry tries to resume dating Melanie after seeing that he is getting nowhere with Bronwyn but Melanie turns him down. The following year Melanie reappears and moves in with Mike, Des Clarke and his son Jamie at Number 28. Melanie's chirpy nature immediately wins Des over but when she interferes in his relationship with Jane Harris by taking a call and blasting Jane for <bop>her<eop> decision to end things with Des, he is angered but comes to realise a long-distance relationship with <bop>Jane<eop> would not feasible and forgives Melanie.
False	The Millingtons continued to record together after Fanny as well, most recently on the 2011 album Play Like a Girl on June's label Fabulous Records. Nickey Barclay released a solo album titled Diamond in a Junkyard in 1976 then withdrew from the music industry. Alice de Buhr later worked in marketing for several major record labels and presently runs the Fanny website. Patti Quatro continued to work as a session musician for <bop>her<eop> sister <bop>Suzi Quatro<eop> as well as Electric Light Orchestra on A New World Record in 1976, Keith Moon, and France Gall, and recently has been involved in the reissue of material by the Quatro sisters' early band the Pleasure Seekers.

False	After review, RMNB stands by its translation as the writers felt the professional translation and their own were nearly identical in meaning and therefore accurate. Leading into the Capitals 2011-12 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals matchup against the Boston Bruins, <bop>Hassett<eop> published an article discussing Tim Thomas's performance after <bop>he<eop> snubbed the U.S. president Barack Obama during the Bruins' Stanley Cup celebration at the White House.
False	Galkin was nervous, and when Pelton asked him why, he said with humor that he had never been on CNN before referring to his career as a spy.

False	Clifton tells Perry that Eugene is running detention and preventing the sell of weed there, leading to reduced profits for Perry. Tahime proves to be an excellent strategist on the Chess board. Tahime invites another student (Peanut) in on the crimes they are engaged in. The principal receives an anonymous tip (from <bop>Perry<eop>) that Eugene is an ex-con and she is forced to fire <bop>him<eop>.
False	He also served on the staff of the Minnesota Ski-U-Mah, a scholastic publication. Jacobi met August Derleth in January 1931 when Derleth was visiting Minneapolis to see Donald Wandrei. <bop>Jacobi<eop> had read Derleth's stories in Weird Tales and <bop>his<eop> Solar Pons stories in Dragnet and asked to be introduced; they met for an evening at the Rainbow Cafe.
False	An Artists Edition was released by IDW Publishing in August 2013 and contains oversized reprints of the original art from issues 9 - 14 of the series. While these collections all contain the complete original series written by <bop>Mark Schultz<eop>, only the Kitchen Sink releases contain the backup stories written by Steve Stiles, though in 2012 Flesk Publications made it clear they were hunting for the original art from <bop>his<eop> stories for a future release.
False	He arranged for a justice of the peace and took out a marriage license on August 12, 1806. On August 16, he rode to Polly's house with family and friends, determined to ride off with Polly to be married elsewhere. <bop>Polly<eop>'s father pleaded with Crockett to have the wedding in the Finley home. Crockett agreed only after Jean apologized for <bop>her<eop> past treatment of him.
True	She was so upset that she called off the wedding and their friends Paddy and Emily got married instead. However, Marlon and Tricia did eventually marry a few months later. <bop>Tricia<eop> was offered the chance to star in a Bollywood film and went to India for six months. While <bop>she<eop> was away, Marlon was dreadfully lonely and had a drunken one night stand with his cousin Charity.
True	<bop>Douglas Spotted Eagle<eop>, is a Grammy -winning musician, noted for <bop>his<eop> live and recorded performances on the traditional Native American flute, sometimes accompanied by either traditional Navajo (Din*) singers and instrumentalists or a modern band.
False	Other sources have explained Powell's injury differently; Miles Davis said Powell was beaten by a Savoy Ballroom bouncer after walking in the club without any money, while Dexter Gordon claimed he was beaten while in police custody after his arrest for drunk and disorderly conduct in a Philadelphia train station. Monk recorded ``In Walked Bud'' several times during his career, starting with the 1947 sessions later compiled for Genius of Modern Music (1951). According to music critic <bop>Robert Christgau<eop>, Monk's rendition of the song for <bop>his<eop> 1958 live album Misterioso featured ``a long, laconically hilarious (and laconically, hilariously virtuosic) Johnny Griffin solo that's a landmark of saxophony''.
True	Tina's girlfriend, an attractive young Chinese woman named Maggie Lah, comes to visit him shortly thereafter. <bop>Maggie<eop> realises something is wrong on arriving at Tina's apartment, as the front door has been left open, and enters the apartment trying not to attract notice. Koko realises <bop>she<eop> has entered but is not sure of her whereabouts.
True	His only criticism was that Dwight seemed too over-the-top, particularly while wielding a knife during the cold open lip dub. <bop>Kevin Fitzpatrick<eop> of UGO Networks said that this was a good episode, but not an especially important one which failed to advance any ongoing story lines. Although <bop>he<eop> called scenes like Michael spanking Luke and his defense of Luke during the meeting as ``classic Scott'', Fitzpatrick also said the episode does little to start establishing a proper send-off for the character's final season.
True	Tsukasa works part-time at the sushi bar which is owned by her family, as well as her residence. Kohei falls in love with her if you cannot end up with any of the five heroines, which is known as the Bad End Route. <bop>Kaya<eop> is Erika and Iori's mother. Estimated to be at least 251 years old, yet <bop>she<eop> looks like a child, giving people the image that she is Iori and Erika's younger sister instead.
False	Later, he puts Kohei in charge of Athletic Meet as the new Student Council Officer. Kohei ends up with a lot of work in order to make the Athletic Meet a success. <bop>Haruna<eop>, Kanade, and Heiji arrive at evening tea time and encourage Kohei with <bop>his<eop> efforts.
False	However, Shiro offers her blood but she refuses. The episode begins with Erika being in prison. Iori tells Kohei that after a vampire draws blood directly from human they will keep desiring blood more and more.

False	However, after Korra was incapacitated and nearly rendered powerless by an enemy Amon, leader of a subversive movement who specialized in taking away the bending abilities of people, she revealed to Tenzin her deep-seated fears of Amon, crying on Tenzin's shoulder. Tenzin offered her comfort and a higher level of trust was established between the two. Later when Republic City came under attack from Amon's forces, Tenzin, <bop>his<eop> wife and their children were ultimately captured by <bop>Amon<eop> and were facing the real prospect of losing their bending when they were rescued by Korra and Mako.
False	He argues ejusdem generis that the Constitution's unenumerated rights (such as the 9th Amendment or the Privileges or Immunities clause of the 14th Amendment) are procedural in nature rather than substantive, thus protecting rights to democratic processes but not rights of a substantive nature. Justice Stone's Footnote Four from United States v. <bop>Carolene Products Co.<eop> (1938) is a chief inspiration for Ely's theory of judicial review.

False	He is best known for his intense and sometimes controversial interpretations of opera, especially works by Italian composers and Richard Strauss.

Nevertheless, Ryan Bray of Consequence of Sound was rather mixed in <bop>his<eop> review, stating: ``From the lean, scrappy production value to the grandiose guitar solos and <bop>Alex Coxen<eop>'s wobbling, vocal delivery a la Grant Hart, the record has the messy fingerprints of indie rock's cherished first wave smeared all over it.''

True	She filled up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Hellenic Olympic Committee, as Greece received an automatic berth for being the host nation. Amassed the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall, <bop>Vryoni<eop> was haplessly pinned by Ukraine's Svetlana Saenko in <bop>her<eop> opening match, but bounced back to defeat Mongolia's Ochirbatyn Burmaa with an arduous 3--4 decision.
False	A frequent social -- and then romantic -- Elm Tree Road visitor was Bettine (Athalia) Stokes Edwards, an American girl who danced in Chu Chin Chow (and daughter of Robert Ewing Edwards of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) who became Mercer's first wife. The New York Times announcement of their engagement (28 August 1919) states: ``Mr & Mrs Glover Fitzhugh Perin of 57 West Fifty-eight street have announced the engagement of <bop>Mrs Perin<eop>'s oldest daughter Miss Bettine Stokes Edwards... '' suggesting that <bop>her<eop> father either was dead or divorced; her remarried mother then lived in New York City.
False	One writer noted that nothing had been moved or replaced, changed, or modernized, from the books in the library to the appliances in the kitchen and the fixtures in the bathrooms. Noted columnist <bop>Jack Smith<eop> visited the estate in 1973 and wrote that ``time stood still'', as Lloyd's clothes still hung in <bop>his<eop> closet, and the master bedroom and living room ``looked like a set for a movie of the 1930s.''
True	The article declares that Manhigut will never ``bow to political correctness'', and that ``MK Moshe Feiglin understands this concept very well''. Sackett had close ties with Rabbis Meir and Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane, and there are several ideological similarities. <bop>Feiglin<eop> advocates encouraging emigration of all Arabs under Israel's jurisdiction, with financial incentives. <bop>He<eop> supports annexing all parts of the Land of Israel under Israeli control, developing a legal system more consistent with Jewish values, and restricting Israeli citizenship to Jews and those non-Jews loyal to the State of Israel.
False	Leacock would teach at MIT until his retirement in 1989. In 1989 he moved to Paris, where he met Valerie Lalonde and, together, they made Les Oeufs a la Coque de Richard Leacock (84 minutes), the first major film shot with a tiny Video-8 Handycam to be broadcast on prime-time television in France. Leacock and Lalonde continued making films of their own choice without the pressures of TV producers, notably A Musical Adventure in Siberia, in collaboration with conductor Sarah Caldwell, his daughter Victoria Leacock and filmmaker <bop>Vincent Blanchet<eop>. Leacock died on 23 March 2011 at age the age of 89 in Paris. Before <bop>his<eop> death, he was raising funds for his multi-format memoir, The Feeling of Being There - A Filmmaker's Memoir, a bound paper book and DVB (digital video book), published by Seme*on Editions.
False	Descartes specifically said that error comes about because the will is not limited to judging things which the understanding is limited to, and described the possibility of such judging or choosing things ignorantly, without understanding them, as free will. Under the influence of Bacon and <bop>Descartes<eop>, Thomas Hobbes made one of the first attempts to systematically analyze ethical and political matters in a modern way. <bop>He<eop> defined will in his Leviathan Chapter VI, in words which explicitly criticize the medieval scholastic definitions:
False	In Sacrifice Kyle Katarn voices his disbelief that Boba Fett was staying neutral and was concerned with the fact that GA forces had assassinated Dur Gejjen, Corellian Prime Minister. In Inferno <bop>Kyle Katarn<eop>, Kenth Hamner and Kyp Durron stand up to Jacen Solo at Mara's funeral, telling <bop>him<eop> to take a seat in the Jedi Knights row.
False	Swick's first fight in the show came during the semi-finals. He faced Stephan Bonnar, but was defeated by triangle armbar at 4:55 of the first round, eliminating him from the show. At The Ultimate Fighter 1 Finale, Swick defeated Alex Schoenauer by knockout just 20 seconds into the first round, earning the nickname ``Quick'' from UFC announcer <bop>Mike Goldberg<eop>. Though <bop>he<eop> had lost the show, Swick signed a contract with the UFC.
True	Carrillo developed an easy method for notation, which would help people not familiar with previous forms of notation to quickly learn to read and write music. To show how easy the new writing system was, <bop>Carrillo<eop> gave two New York elementary school boys, who had no prior knowledge of Sonido 13, a simple work by Bach to convert to <bop>his<eop> notation system.
False	With the win, the Colts improved to 7--0 for the fourth time in five seasons and they set a franchise record with 15 consecutive regular season wins. Also, quarterback Peyton Manning (31/48 for 347 yards) joined Dan Marino, <bop>Brett Favre<eop>, and John Elway as the only players in NFL history to complete 4,000 career passes. In addition, <bop>he<eop> became the fastest to reach the milestone as he reached it in 183 games.
False	In the 1990 NFL Draft he was selected in the ninth round by the Minnesota Vikings. His rookie year, he was the second string running back behind Herschel Walker. The next year, the Vikings got rid of <bop>Walker<eop> and Allen was named the starter. That year, <bop>he<eop> ran for 1,201 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns.
False	SENSE OF WONDER n. a feeling of awakening or awe triggered by an expansion of one's awareness of what is possible or by confrontation with the vastness of space and time, as brought on by reading science fiction. <bop>Jon Radoff<eop> has characterised a sense of wonder as an emotional reaction to the reader suddenly confronting, understanding, or seeing a concept new in the context of new information. In the introductory section of <bop>his<eop> essay 'On the Grotesque in Science Fiction', Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr., Professor of English, DePauw University, states:
True	She is best remembered today for portraying Brang*ne in the world premiere of Richard Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde in 1865 and Helmwige in the premiere of Wagner's Die Walk*re in 1869. Born in Frankfurt am Main, <bop>Deinet<eop> studied under Elise Seebach before making <bop>her<eop> professional opera debut at the opera house in Frankfurt as Gabriele in Conradin Kreutzer 's Das Nachtlager in Granada in 1861.
False	Her son, Edward Rath III, recently won his election for the Erie County Legislature for her former seat. In 1998 she was reportedly considered by Gov. George Pataki as his running mate for lieutenant governor. Pataki choose Judge <bop>Mary Donohue<eop> instead. During <bop>her<eop> service in the Senate, Senator Rath served at different times as Chairwoman of the Tourism, Recreation and Sports Development Committee, Chairwoman of the Children and Families Committee and as Chairwoman of the Local Government Committee.
False	The company paid Tamagno a cash advance of 2000 pounds sterling to make his first lot of ``78s''. He also received royalties from the company for every individually numbered, custom-labelled pressing that sold. <bop>Roland Gelatt<eop>'s revised edition of The Fabulous Phonograph (Collier Books, New York, 1977, p.*119) asserts that Tamagno's recording contract, signed in December 1902, was the first to embody ``the royalty principle''. Gelatt states that Tamagno approved 19 recordings from <bop>his<eop> Ospedaletti session for release to the public.
False	Jean de Bourbon (1381--1434) was Duke of Bourbon, from 1410 to his death and Duke of Auvergne since 1416. He was the eldest son of <bop>Louis II<eop> and Anna d'Auvergne. Through <bop>his<eop> mother, John inherited the County of Forez.
True	AlAhly refused again to let go of El-Hadary, but El-Hadary refused to let go of his final chance to explore new horizons, so he ended unilaterally his contract with Al-Ahly in an event that was the most debating in the Egyptian football history for months. The case of El-Hadary vs. Al-Ahly vs. FC Sion is being ruled by FIFA until the time these lines were written. During his stint at Al-Ahly, <bop>El-Hadary<eop> had the best chance to be trained by Ahmed Nagy so <bop>he<eop> achieved some impressive feats in over 500 appearances for the club in which he scored 1 goal.
False	Savile was four times married: to Jane, daughter of Richard Garth of Morden, Surrey, by whom he had issue a son Henry, and two daughters; to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Wentworth of North Elmsall, Yorkshire, by whom he had issue John (died 1651), who was heir to his half-brother Henry, and great-grandfather of John Savile, 1st Earl of Mexborough (1720--1778); to Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Wentworth (died 1551), and widow of Sir W.

True	This was followed by further works as executive and line producer before he started in 1996 on a project to develop a cultural centre in the city of Z*rich. Boesiger is currently active again as producer and writer of various English language projects. In particular 'Rafiq & Judith' is in development and is planned for production summer 2017. Besides <bop>his<eop> main career as a producer, <bop>Johannes Boesiger<eop> was active between 1989 and 1995 on the management board of the Locarno International Film Festival, co-founder of the Carl Mayer Scriptwriting award in Graz, Austria, and lately in 2007 together with Dieter Kosslick, was one of the initiators of the section ``culinary cinema'' at the Berlin International Film Festival today directed by Thomas Struck.
False	After Gettysburg, Webb received command of the division six weeks later and led it through the fall campaigns. His division played a prominent role in the Battle of Bristoe Station. When <bop>Gibbon<eop> returned to command in the spring of 1864, Webb went back to brigade command for the Overland Campaign. At the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, in May, <bop>he<eop> was hit by a bullet that passed through the corner of his right eye and came out his ear, but did not impair his mental abilities.
False	The obolus, along with the mirror, was a symbol of new schismatic heretics in the short story ``The Theologians'' by Argentine author <bop>Jorge Luis Borges<eop>. In the story's discussion of the circularity of time, eternity, and the transmigration of the soul through several bodies the author uses a quote of Luke 12:59, mistranslated as ``no one will be released from prison until <bop>he<eop> has paid the last obolus'' since Luke calls the coin a lepton (a somewhat smaller denomination) rather than an obolus.
True	This was the infamous occasion when Woodgate entered the event twice, using the name Wat Bradford in the other entry when he partnered another Kingstonian M M Brown. The rules of entry at the regatta were subsequently revised to prevent this. Corrie partnered M M Brown in 1867 to win Silver Goblets again. In 1870 <bop>Corrie<eop> partnered E Hall for <bop>his<eop> third win of SIlver Goblets.
True	Many action were too dangerous for Li because he has passed down his physical prime despite being a wushu champion. Jet Li also hurt his ankle badly on the set so Hung had to perform a lot of action. <bop>Hung<eop> was then Li's stunt double again in the sequel, Once Upon a Time in China II. <bop>He<eop> was also featured a role as the leader of the White Lotus Sect.
False	Robert Martin died in 1355, his wife surviving him until 1373, when the manor passed to her eldest son by her first husband, Sir Walter de Romsey. It then passed by inheritance into the Keilway family, it being held by John Keilway on his death in 1547. His son Francis died in 1601--2, and <bop>his<eop> son <bop>Thomas<eop> succeeded to Rockbourne, which, already heavily mortgaged to Sir Anthony Ashley, he sold in 1608 to Sir Anthony's son-in-law, Sir John Cooper.
False	The party was founded in 1969, by Tom Burgess a disaffected former Liberal MHA who crossed the floor to become an independent when he was passed over for a cabinet seat. He was re-elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from Labrador West in the 1971 provincial election under the New Labrador Party banner. The election returned a hung parliament. Burgess initially indicated that <bop>he<eop> would support the opposition Progressive Conservative Party's bid to form a government and unseat Premier <bop>Joey Smallwood<eop>'s Liberals but, days after Conservative leader Frank Moores was sworn in as Premier, Burgess was enticed to rejoin the Liberals under the false promise that he would succeed Joey Smallwood as Liberal leader and Premier.
True	Bergen successfully convinces Hilary to fly into Wistful Vista. Meanwhile, Jerry and Marge, still searching for Julie, have decided that they are still in love and get married. Back at the McGees', Molly discovers that <bop>Julie<eop> is in love with Bergen and advises <bop>her<eop> to ``sabotage'' him into marriage.
False	Gilbert Cruz of Entertainment Weekly called the book ``half an account of Ken's life-halting obsession with reconstructing his mythical older brother and half the biography that David always expected as a soon-to-be-famous author.'' <bop>Matthew Sweet<eop> of The Independent wrote, ``Ken Dornstein's project--<bop>his<eop> researches and the book that they have become--is both a loving tribute to the memory of his dead brother and an act of destruction and erasure...
True	Sullivan never had sought elective office when, in 1986, he ran for and won the Democratic nomination for governor. Many observers believed that, following three terms with a Democratic governor (Ed Herschler) the chances for another Democrat to gain that post would be remote. Nonetheless, after a hard-fought campaign, <bop>Sullivan<eop> defeated Republican nominee Peter K. Simpson. In <bop>his<eop> 1990 reelection, he defeated the rancher and businesswoman Mary Hansen Mead of Jackson, daughter of former Republican Governor and U.S. Senator Clifford P. Hansen.
False	At age 14 Franks bought his first guitar, a Japanese Marco Polo for $29.95 with six private lessons included - the only music education that he received. At University High in Irvine, <bop>Franks<eop> discovered the poetry of Theodore Roethke with <bop>his<eop> off-rhymes and hidden meter.
True	Robertson's pioneering, unconventional use of the wah-pedal as an extension of the instrument during soloing rather than as a purely rhythmic effect provided a boost to the band as well. In 1978 <bop>Robertson<eop> finally left the band and was replaced by guitarist Gary Moore, whom <bop>he<eop> had replaced in 1974.
True	Both seem relieved by this mutual honesty on difficult topics. At a gas station, Tony spots Fabian Petrulio, a former member of the DiMeo crime family who turned FBI informant and was relocated under the Witness Protection Program. Tony resolves to locate and execute Petrulio while continuing his trip with Meadow. After leaving <bop>his<eop> daughter at a college bar, <bop>Tony<eop> confirms Petrulio's identity when he sees a bust of Ronald Reagan in his office, similar to those Petrulio had sculpted while in prison.
True	In all, Miller wrote twice the number of opinions as any of his colleagues on the Court, leading future Chief Justice William Rehnquist to describe him as ``very likely the dominant figure'' on the Court in his time. When Chief Justice <bop>Salmon P. Chase<eop> died in 1873, attorneys and law journals across the country lobbied for Miller to be appointed to succeed <bop>him<eop>, but President Ulysses Grant was determined to appoint an outsider.
False	The firm of Triebert, which was the dominant oboe-making concern in mid-19th century France, fell to pieces with the death of sole proprietor Fr*d*ric Triebert in 1879. By 1882 it had changed management thrice and was eventually sold to the mass-maker Gautrot, itself purchased in 1884 by Couesnon. <bop>Fr*d*ric Triebert<eop>'s last foreman, Fran*ois Lor*e (1835-1902), formed <bop>his<eop> own oboe making company in 1881, carrying on Triebert's work and tradition.
False	Buckner was raised in Detroit, where he played very early in his career before joining McKinney's Cotton Pickers. He was best known for his time spent in the orchestra of Jimmie Lunceford, where he remained from 1937 to 1943. After working with <bop>Lunceford<eop>, Buckner primarily played locally in Detroit, where <bop>he<eop> worked into the 1970s.
True	There he became acquainted with John Smeaton, who during the course of his studies on windmills had devised a descriptive scale for grading wind speed. This scale was included in the paper for which he was awarded the Copley Medal. In Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale and How a 19th-Century Admiral Turned Science into Poetry author <bop>Scott Huler<eop> relates that Dalrymple's voyages had convinced <bop>him<eop> that a standard scale for measuring the speed of wind at sea would be of great value to sailors, and that he had included Smeaton's scale in his work Practical Navigation, which was written around 1790 but never published.
False	In an article in Contemporary Authors, published two years before her first full-length book of poetry, Finch made a remark that anticipates the focus of her career ``To me, poetic form, with its unverbal, physical power, is radically important in reconnecting us with our human roots and rediscovering our intimacy with nature . . .. rhythmic formal poetry is of great value in celebrating, commemorating, and cementing the bonds of community.'' As <bop>Claire Keyes<eop> notes in the entry on Finch in Scribner's American Writers, ``A strong current in <bop>her<eop> work is the decentering of the self, a theme which stems from her deep connection with the natural world and her perception of the self as part of nature.''
True	In preparation for his fight with Bisping, Akiyama switched to Jackson's Submission Fighting in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is unclear whether the switch is permanent. Even though <bop>Akiyama<eop> lost to Bisping, <bop>he<eop> rocked him in the first round.
True	David Meli - (175 cm 76 kg) born 11 Sep 1992 in PNG was drafted by Essendon Football Club through its international rookie list in 2009 Meli was a member of the international champion PNG Mosquitos at just 16 years of age.

False	She married Sir Man-kam Lo, a prominent Eurasian lawyer and legislator who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II after World War II. Their son, Lo Tak-shing, was a former lawyer and legislator in Hong Kong who once ran against Tung Chee Hwa for Chief Executive. Three other daughters -- <bop>Irene Cheng<eop>, Jean Gittins and Florence Yeo -- wrote memoirs chronicling their war-time experiences in colonial Hong Kong. Jean Gittins migrated to Melbourne Australia after the World War where <bop>she<eop> worked in the Pathology Department of Melbourne University.

True	Marianne Lilly, before being incarcerated in the asylum by her evil brother, changed her will, leaving one half of her wealth to her own daughter, Susan, and the other half to Maud. Mrs Sucksby explains to Maud that she has no choice but to comply with the rest of the plan. <bop>Maud<eop> is further devastated to learn that they have no intention of rescuing Sue from the asylum. Acknowledging the wrong <bop>she<eop> has done, Maud knows she must escape Mrs Sucksby if she is to rescue Sue.
False	When she does, she finds out that she doesn't have the same blood type as him, implying that he may not be her real, biological father. At dinner later on that night, Tammy and Kimberly have a vicious argument that leads to <bop>Tammy<eop> revealing that Kimberly is Byron's birth mother, having had him when <bop>she<eop> was 13 years old.
False	Everybody leaves the dinner later on that afternoon due to the constant arguing as well as their own reasons, and Shirley doesn't get the chance to tell them about her cancer. During the night, Byron and Renee sneak inside Shirley's house to sleep there, but Byron is arrested by the police for failing to pay child support. <bop>Shirley<eop> goes to Kimberly's house to ask <bop>her<eop> to bail him out, but Kimberly refuses.
False	Shirley's children Byron (Shad ``Bow Wow'' Moss), Tammy (Natalie Desselle-Reid), and Kimberly (Shannon Kane) arrive at Shirley's house later that day for a dinner Shirley has planned for them in order to tell them the sad news about her recent prognosis from Dr. Evans. Byron arrives with his girlfriend Renee (Lauren London) and <bop>his<eop> baby <bop>Byron Jr. Tammy<eop> arrives with her husband Harold (Rodney Perry) and their two kids.
True	Akano was part of the one-night Strikeforce 135-pound women's tournament on August 13, 2010 at . A random drawing was held on the day of the weigh-ins to determine first-round matchups and Akano faced Carina Damm in the opening round of the tournament. <bop>Akano<eop> submitted Damm with a triangle armbar in the second round to advance to the tournament final. <bop>She<eop> faced Miesha Tate and was defeated by Unanimous Decision.
False	The dilemma is resolved when the Reverend of Grayson engineers a polygamous marriage of Honor to Hamish and his crippled wife Emily.

False	I thought I was a hard worker but after watching her I was really amazed by her work level.'' They train at the Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. They initially worked with Velikov but <bop>Kavaguti<eop> had been training with Tamara Moskvina since 1998 and preferred to stay with <bop>her<eop>.

True	Black Kettle continued to speak for peace and did not join in the second raid or in the journey to the Powder River country. He left the camp and returned with 80 lodges to the Arkansas River to seek peace with the Coloradoans. Despite threats against <bop>his<eop> life, Captain <bop>Silas Soule<eop> testified against Chivington.
True	By 6 August when both Soult and Mortier were massed for battle, they found their quarry had withdrawn across the Tagus. As it happened, this was the only opportunity that the French had for inflicting great damage on the Spanish army. As historian Charles Oman wrote, ``Soult's best chance was gone before he was even aware of it.'' Worried about <bop>his<eop> supply line to Portugal, <bop>Wellesley<eop> ordered Craufurd to march west with his own brigade and General Rufane Donkin's brigade to cover the Almaraz crossing.
True	In his second game, Thomas won a penalty, reacted to a rebound off the crossbar to score his first goal for the club, and set up a goal for Marc Pugh in a 3--1 victory over Leyton Orient. He began to develop a partnership with Michael Symes which both parties and manager Lee Bradbury thought could become productive. The day after <bop>his<eop> move to Bournemouth was made permanent, <bop>Thomas<eop> and Symes each scored in a 2--0 defeat of Wycombe Wanderers.
False	The game was fairly competitive until the final seconds of the first half when Eagles' defensive end Hugh Douglas delivered a hit to Miller that resulted in a separated shoulder. <bop>Shane Matthews<eop> replaced Jim Miller, who had only thrown 3 completions on 5 pass attempts with an interception in what was to become <bop>his<eop> lone playoff appearance.
True	After being shot in the house which Sykes attempts to rob, Oliver is taken back to Fagin's lair to recover, rather than being nursed back to health in the countryside by the Maylie family, as in the novel. It is Nancy's informing Rose, and a highly sceptical Mr <bop>Brownlow<eop>, of Oliver's whereabouts that results in her demise at the hands of Sykes. Her ghost continues to haunt <bop>him<eop> when he returns to London with Oliver, resulting in him choosing to hang himself in the sewers as a means of escaping the London crowds who chase him.
False	The name Wells honored Madison P. Wells, local rancher. The town was renamed Keene in honor of James P. Keene, a financier. The UFW moved its national headquarters to Keene from Delano, California. C*sar Ch*vez spent his last years in Keene. The walls of <bop>his<eop> United Farm Workers office in Keene were lined with hundreds of books ranging in subject from philosophy, economics, cooperatives, and unions, to biographies of <bop>Gandhi<eop> and the Kennedys, The Kama Sutra, the memoirs of Che Guevara, and ``The Good German:

False	In 1997--98, Easton was more of a first team regular, featuring in thirty-five matches, with notable firsts including playing in a UEFA Cup match and scoring his first goal in the League Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen. The following season, Easton continued to play in the majority of matches and repeated this trend over the next few seasons.

False	This time she landed back to Peoria in 1949 and again suffered from the horrendous offensive deficiencies of a last-place team, ending with a 5-14 record and a 2.18 ERA that year. She pitched her final season in 1950 and was 3-4 with a 2.51 ERA for Peoria. When asked about the 1992 film A League of Their Own, a fictionalized account of activities in the AAGPBL created by <bop>Penny Marshall<eop>, Lee said the film was about 70% accurate.

False	Benson bought his products to keep Mordecai and Rigby from slacking off, but they manage to constantly evade him, causing Benson to accidentally summon him to the park to watch over everybody and as a result, he cannot leave until they die (due to the contract that <bop>Benson<eop> signed without even reading it). After spooking everyone with <bop>his<eop> gazes, Mordecai challenges him to a staring contest in which Peeps must leave if Mordecai wins but if Peeps wins, he will harvest their eyes.
True	<bop>Eileen Roberts<eop> (voiced by Minty Lewis, a writer/storyboard artist for the series) is a shy and timid mole who works at a local coffee shop, previously alongside Margaret. <bop>She<eop> has a crush on Rigby, but he initially found her annoying.
False	Rigby and Mordecai must then try to stop Ybgir from turning the entire city into zombies. They eventually un-jinx Ybgir, which sends him back to the mirror, defeating him until he returns. <bop>Percy<eop> is the name of a Victorian Doll that Pops had owned ever since <bop>he<eop> was a child.
False	When Rutherford commission portraits of past presidents were commissioned for the White House, Lucy insisted that paintings of both Martha Washington and Dolley Madison also grace the walls of the presidential mansion.

False	Planning to con a big sum of money from her, Wai sets up a plan with his acquaintances Yam Sai-sung (Simon Yam) and Yip Mei-mei (Amy Yip). However, Susan turns out to be swindler as well. Unable to salvage a fortune from <bop>Susan<eop>, Wai, Sung and Mei become indebted to <bop>her<eop>.
True	He is considered one of the most powerful men in Syria and according to Syrian analysts no foreign company can do business in Syria without his consent and partnership. He is a part of Bashar Assad's inner circle. <bop>Rami Makhlouf<eop> is one of the wealthiest individuals in Syria and the cousin of Bashar Assad. <bop>He<eop> is related to the Assad family through his aunt Anisa Makhlouf who is the wife of former Syrian President Hafez Assad.
False	``I would call the material a rich musical heritage,'' Sirmay told the New York Times. ``There is enough material for one or two Broadway musical scores. There are dozens of excellent songs.'' Though he lived in America for most of <bop>his<eop> later years and was a good friend of <bop>Gershwin<eop>, Szirmai eschewed the jazz styles popular at the time; in addition to the folk music of his native Hungary, his music shows the influence of German Romanticism, particularly Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann, whom he most admired.
True	He advocated treating offenders like the mentally ill. His subsequent books include The Vital Balance, Man Against Himself and Love Against Hate. In 1981, Menninger was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter. In 1985, the Menninger School of Psychiatry was named for him. On October 6, 1988, less than two years before <bop>his<eop> death, <bop>Karl Menninger<eop> wrote a letter to Thomas Szasz, author of The Myth of Mental Illness.
False	New York City Transit, Metro-North Railroad, Long Island Railroad, Long Island Bus, and Bridges and Tunnels. Mr. Conway, at his request, served without compensation. He is currently chairman of Rittenhouse Advisors and a member of the board of Urstadt Biddle Properties. Before <bop>his<eop> appointment as MTA Chairman by Governor <bop>George E. Pataki<eop>, Conway was a member of the MTA Board.
False	Scarlett Johnson (born 1985) also known as Scarlett Alice Johnson is a British actress Johnson attended Highgate Wood School and Performing Arts College where she was spotted by an agent in a production of Guys and Dolls in which she played the lead. The role of <bop>Vicki Fowler<eop> on the BBC's flagship soap opera EastEnders was Johnson's first television role though not <bop>her<eop> professional d*but, having previously appeared in numerous stage productions, including a six-month run in an acclaimed National Theatre production of Dylan Thomas ' Under Milk Wood directed by Roger Michell.
False	In the Velvet Room, Margaret reads their guest's fortune, and warns him that a great danger approaches and he might not be strong enough to face it, even with all of his Arcanas thus far. Yu, Yosuke, <bop>Chie<eop>, Yukiko and Kanji go into the television world in order to save Rise, finding <bop>her<eop> at a strip joint.
False	Yu attempts to trace his memories back to his first arrival in Inaba, only to relive the same day yet again. He figures out, thanks to <bop>Nanako<eop>, that he shook hands with a gas station attendant before heading to Dojima's house. Going to the gas station, the attendant, revealed to be the goddess Izanami, reveals that <bop>she<eop> gave Yu the power to enter the television world by shaking hands, also being the case with Adachi and Namatame.
True	On 3 January 1927, Gibbs was out driving a launch at Port Hacking when he noticed Mervyn Allum struggling in the water. Thinking the youth was drowning, Gibbs made his way to the nose of the launch in order to give assistance to Allum. It was then that <bop>Gibbs<eop> realised Allum was being attacked by a shark, and <bop>he<eop> immediately dived into the water.
False	During this period, the Yaocomico taught the colonists how to survive in Maryland's challenging environment. The chief also later put his daughter, the Piscataway Indian princess, Mary Kittamaquund, under the guardianship of a prominent colonist, <bop>Margaret Brent<eop>, so that Mary could learn English ways and become a bridge and a translator between the two cultures. <bop>Her<eop> English first name was given to her by the colonists.
False	A former dentist, Macek is well known for his association with current Czech President V*clav Klaus, his deep implication in the occult funding of Klaus' ODS party, his attempt to ``privatise'' for himself a large publishing company. In May 2006 Macek made international news when, coming from behind, he struck the Minister of Health David Rath at a dentists' conference, accusing him of having insulted his wife (after <bop>Rath<eop> had publicly stated that Macek had married <bop>his<eop> wife for money).
False	The same year, Jerry Seelen wrote the English lyrics for the recording of Johnny Desmond with Tony Mottola and his Orchestra on May 11, 1949. The title of the song is not translated into English. The German lyrics were written in 1950 by <bop>Ralph Maria Siegel<eop> for the recording of Rita Gallos with Kurt Edelhagen and <bop>his<eop> Orchestra on May 30, 1950.
False	After several months of captivity Duane is released by Granny Ruth, who is preparing to take everyone on a road trip to the home of her ex-husband Doctor Hal Rockwell, who will help in giving birth to Belial's equally misshapen girlfriend Eve's babies; before leaving for the trip, Granny Ruth sternly tells Duane to stay away from Belial, who has stopped speaking to Duane telepathically after Duane's attempt to put them back together. While traveling via bus to <bop>Hal<eop>'s house in Peachtree County the group stop at a drug store, where Granny Ruth meets local sheriff Andrew Griffin while Duane, attempting to wriggle out a bus window, meets the sheriff's daughter Opal, who <bop>he<eop> tries to convince help him and Belial escape.
False	While traveling via bus to Hal's house in Peachtree County the group stop at a drug store, where Granny Ruth meets local sheriff Andrew Griffin while Duane, attempting to wriggle out a bus window, meets the sheriff's daughter Opal, who he tries to convince help him and Belial escape. Before Duane can talk to <bop>Opal<eop> any further, Granny Ruth returns and boards the bus and heads back on track to Hal's house, having sweet talked Sheriff Griffin into letting <bop>her<eop> leave despite the bus being illegally parked.
True	In the early 90s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for Confederate Railroad 's 1993 No. 1 hit, ``Trashy Woman''. Seely has also played at Dolly Parton 's ``Dollywood'' and served as Brad Paisley 's date for the 2000 CMA awards show. <bop>Lorrie Morgan<eop> has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for <bop>her<eop> 1997 album, Shakin' Things Up.
True	The Cangrejeros advanced to the playoffs, defeating Caguas in a seven-game semifinal. Santurce won the finals series sweeping the Indios. Cepeda broke a record by hitting 19 home runs throughout the season, while <bop>Pizarro<eop> did so by recording seven straight strikeouts against Ponce as part of <bop>his<eop> fifth consecutive year leading the LBPPR in strikeouts.
False	Manuel Ant*nio Vasconcelos (Pilar da Bretanha - Rabo de Peixe), journalist and founder of the newspapers A*oriano Oriental and O Temp; Ruy Galv*o de Carvalho (Rabo de Peixe, 3 November 1903 -- Ponta Delgada; 29 April 1991), poet, author, essayist and professor, who was notable for <bop>his<eop> biography of the life and published works of <bop>Antero de Quental<eop>, and a diverse literary collection under the pseudonym Abd-el Kader, as well as his Antologia Po*tica dos A*ores Ant*nio Tavares Torres (Rabo de Peixe; 13 June 1856 -- Rabo de Peixe, 28 September 1936), a self-taught intellectual, journalist, poet, lyricist (responsible for the first regional anthem Autonomia dos A*ores) and politician (member of the Partido Progressista, president of the Municipal Council of Ribeira Grande and Junta Geral);
False	Further controversy arose when, in 1912, Lasker's terms for a proposed match with Akiba Rubinstein included a clause that, if Lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match, Rubinstein should become world champion (American Chess Bulletin, October 1913). When <bop>he<eop> resumed negotiations with <bop>Capablanca<eop> after World War I, Lasker insisted on a similar clause that if Lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match, Capablanca should become world champion.
True	A few days later, Isabel sees Graeme in a pub, and phones Ian, who comes to the pub and confirms that Graeme is the man in his memory. <bop>Isabel<eop> is certain that Rose Macloed has been lying about Rory's not having been an organ donor, perhaps in order to protect Graeme. <bop>She<eop> asks her journalist friend Angus to speak to his contacts at the hospital, and he confirms that the young donor of Ian's heart was named Macloed.
False	She visits Rory's mother, Rose, and meets Rose's partner Graeme, who perfectly fits Ian's description of the possible killer. However, Rose insists that Rory was not an organ donor. That evening, Jamie and his lover <bop>Louise<eop> visit Isabel, who is determined to be polite; but <bop>her<eop> jealousy gets the better of her and she is rude to Louise, who leaves with Jamie.
True	Isabel tells Ian about the second Macloed family, and they go together to tell Euan about his son's heart. Afterwards, Ian informs Isabel that he visited West Linton shortly after his operation, and spoke to several people there. From this Isabel concludes that <bop>Ian<eop> must have seen Euan, heard about <bop>his<eop> son's death, and subconsciously connected Euan's face with his new heart.
True	<bop>Grace Ruiz<eop> starred in The Chase (BBC 2006) as Daisy Williams. <bop>She<eop> is the daughter of Yvonne Francas, who is the sister of Gaynor Faye, meaning that Grace plays her real life Auntie's daughter in BBC1 drama The Chase.
False	During this period, he was invested with the princely and ducal title of Ozo in recognition of his successes against Portuguese raiders striking inland from the Niger Delta, and indigenous soldiers attacking from provinces to the north. HRH Igwe Amobi I reigned as ruler of Ogidi for 21 years until his death on 18 December 1925. Upon his death, Amobi I was succeeded by <bop>his<eop> eldest son, HRH Prince <bop>Benjamin Olisaeloka Amobi<eop>, who, as HRH Igwe Amobi II of Ogidi, later represented the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria at the coronation of HM King George VI of England in 1937.
False	In 1952 <bop>Cleckley<eop>, along with Walter Bromberg a senior psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, published an article on the insanity defense. They suggested changing the wording of it to: ``In your opinion, was the defendant suffering from disease of the mind and if so, was it sufficient to render <bop>him<eop> unaccountable under the law for the crime charged?''
False	Roosevelt also produced the film Pot o' Gold and distributed the British film Pastor Hall. During his Hollywood period, Roosevelt became involved with Joseph Schenck, the movie mogul who funnelled mob money to the Democratic Party. Schenck also lent money for Roosevelt's movie. When <bop>Schenck<eop> was jailed for income tax evasion, Roosevelt interceded with <bop>his<eop> father to pardon him, but again Henry Morgenthau, Jr. vetoed the plan.
True	They find a pack of cigarettes in Becca's purse and a receipt for the purchase - she bought them at the Trip Wire Bar, which is where Frost saw her and followed her home. Sara delivers the news of Cammie's death to <bop>Corey<eop>, who tells Sara about Finn, the daughter <bop>he<eop> had with Cammie, whom they had given up for adoption.
True	It was named for early resident and politician, William Harrison Hardy. A New York native and an entrepreneur, <bop>Hardy<eop> established, with the support of George Alonzo Johnson's steamboat company, a ferry service and a steamboat landing where the Mojave Road crossed the Colorado River. <bop>He<eop> also built and owned the Hardyville - Prescott Road, a toll road from Hardyville to the new Arizona territorial capital of Prescott and raised Angora goats.
True	Bigby had two big hits, one that led to a Marcus Pollard fumble that was recovered by Green Bay's defensive end Aaron Kampman. Green Bay took the lead on the ensuing drive. An exclusive-rights free agent in the 2008 offseason, Bigby signed a one-year tender deal with the Packers. <bop>Bigby<eop> had the Packers' first 2008 interception in season opener against the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football, picking off quarterback Tarvaris Jackson in the fourth quarter. <bop>He<eop> played in just seven games during the season due to injuries and was placed on season-ending injured reserve with a shoulder injury on December 18.
True	Selling the audience on both a relationship and its breakup is a pretty impressive feat for one episode to pull off and Jerrika Hinton deserves a lion's share of the credit for that. `` Writing for ''At Last``, <bop>Siede<eop> was disappointed that the relationship between Kyle and Stephanie wasn't explored more but enjoyed the chemistry between the characters, as well as the tragedy of his death. <bop>She<eop> noted the ''quiet dignity to Stephanie's grief that I'm excited to see Hinton explore in the future.
True	`` On a more critical note, Lauren Hoffman for Cosmopolitan felt that while she enjoyed Hinton's performance, <bop>Edwards<eop> was underutilized compared to earlier interns like ''George and Izzie`` and that it was ''hard to make a character you only really get to play every few weeks feel like yours and I understand why (Jerrika is) moving on. I'm also happy <bop>her<eop> character got to do so without getting murdered or fired, although she's probably going to be legitimately traumatized by the part where she burned a rapist to death?
False	On Stephanie's decision to end the relationship, <bop>Hinton<eop> said, ``She has to let it go and walk away because of the pure reality of the situation: Kyle came to her as a sick person and while they were able to mitigate some of that, the circumstances of <bop>his<eop> illness mean that he will continue to deteriorate, which means he'll continue to require more care.
True	<bop>Christine of Saxony<eop> (25 December 1505 -- 15 April 1549) was a German noble, landgravine of Hesse. <bop>She<eop> was the regent of Hesse in 1547-1549.
False	First owned by Gene Sens, WZLE's first studios were located in what was formerly a shoe store at the Sheffield Shopping Center. The station was programmed by Jeff Baxter; David Mark served as production voice (previously, Baxter was <bop>Jack Riley<eop>'s radio partner at WERE in the 1960s; Mark was the promotional voice of many TV and radio stations around the world from the 1970s, something <bop>he<eop> would continue into the 21st century).
False	At around 12:30 pm on 9 January 2008, Sophie Elliott and her mother Lesley were at the family home in the suburb of Ravensbourne northeast of the city centre when Weatherston arrived unannounced, saying he had a farewell present. A short time later Lesley heard her daughter screaming. A New Zealand Police officer responding to a 111 call from <bop>Lesley<eop> found Weatherston locked in Sophie's bedroom. When asked what he had done, he told the officer ``I killed <bop>her<eop>''.
False	``TV Party'' is driven by Chuck Dukowski's bass line and features Henry Rollins on lead vocals and bellowed backing vocals from band members. The song is light in comparison to other songs from the band's Damaged era. Black Flag guitarist <bop>Greg Ginn<eop> has stated that after ``Rollins joined the band, we couldn't do songs with a sense of humor anymore; <bop>he<eop> got into the serious way-out poet thing.''
False	Throughout the act, Wilma vents some of her frustration at Fred through her lines, while Fred himself realizes the parallels between Scrooge's past and his own recent behavior. During the next scene, at Fezziwig's Christmas party, <bop>Betty<eop> informs Wilma that Maggie has come down with the Bedrock Bug as well; Wilma dons <bop>her<eop> costume and plays Belle.
True	Wilma dons her costume and plays Belle. The rest of the play proceeds as normal: Ernie, a cheerful Bedrock citizen, plays the Ghost of Christmas Present, and <bop>Fred<eop>, witnessing Barney, Betty, Bamm-Bamm, and Pebbles playing the Cragits, continues to realize the depths of <bop>his<eop> recent self-absorption.
False	Alistair Cookie is Cookie Monster's alter ego when hosting ``Monsterpiece Theater'' on Sesame Street. Created as a spoof of the original Masterpiece Theatre host Alistair Cooke, <bop>Alistair Cookie<eop> is basically Cookie Monster in an English smoking jacket and ascot tie, although Cooke was neither a pipe smoker, nor did <bop>he<eop> wear a smoking jacket on Masterpiece Theatre.
True	Poking her head into the room, Mother tells Father to relax and count to 10, an exercise which ends with him covered in red paint from a paint can that he furiously kicked. Downstairs in the kitchen, Mother tells their son, <bop>Wilbur<eop>, to fetch Father a drink of water from the well, as Father struggles to get out onto the roof without damaging it further. The storm finally hits and <bop>he<eop> is caught in a deluge of rain, as well as struggling with lightning and fierce winds that blow the roof tiles into massive 'waves'.
True	On 1 August, it was announced that Wasim Akram would switch his occupied position as the Director of Cricketing Operations from Islamabad United to the Multan Sultans franchise for the 2018 PSL. Earlier, it was rumoured that <bop>Waqar Younis<eop> will unite with Akram to join the team Multan Sultans, though <bop>he<eop> replaced Akram's position at Islamabad United on 14 September.
True	He was instituted by Bishop Thomas Sprat, but his installation was put off when it was discovered that he had taken no higher degree than M.A., and the statutes required that he should be at least B.D. Although he took the degree of D.D, 18 January 1689, he was not installed, and William III shortly afterwards appointed Henry Ullock in his place. <bop>Lowth<eop> declined the oath of allegiance to William, and was in consequence suspended from <bop>his<eop> functions in August 1689, and in the following February deprived of both his livings; he made a fraudulent agreement with his successor in the vicarage.
False	While Carlos Ancona is fictional, his father Eligio Ancona and his brother Antonio Ancona are historical figures, and are the great-great-grandfather and great-grandfather, respectively, of author Rosa Hugener. Some of Carlos Ancona's background, including being the personal journalist of <bop>Pancho Villa<eop> during the Mexican Revolution, was actually lived by Antonio Ancona and passed as family lore to <bop>his<eop> descendants.
False	Amanda grows up in M*rida, Yucatan during the years of the Mexican Revolution, as the country struggles to throw off centuries of repression of indigenous people by their masters, who are of European descent. Amanda is part of the ``divine caste'', but her troubled mother ignores her from the time of her birth and Amanda grows up under the care of her Mayan Indian nurse JOVITA and <bop>Jovita<eop>'s daughter CACHO, who is the same age as Amanda and <bop>her<eop> best friend.
False	``In the early spring he stood above the heights of Miles Canyon ... the line 'I have gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else to gaze on' came into his mind and again he hammered out a complete poem, ``The Call of the Wild''. Conversations with locals led Service to write about things he had not seen (some of which had not actually happened) as well. He did not set foot in Dawson City until 1908, arriving in the Klondike ten years after the Gold Rush when his renown as a writer was already established. After having collected enough poems for a book, Service ``sent the poems to his father, who had emigrated to Toronto, and asked him to find a printing house so they could make it into a booklet. He enclosed a cheque to cover the costs and intended to give these booklets away to his friends in Whitehorse'' for Christmas. His father took the manuscript to <bop>William Briggs<eop> in Toronto, whose employees loved the book. ``The foreman and printers recited the ballads while they worked. A salesman read the proofs out loud as they came off the typesetting machines.`` An ''enterprising salesman sold 1700 copies in advance orders from galley proofs.`` The publisher ''sent Robert's cheque back to <bop>him<eop> and offered a ten percent royalty contract for the book.`
False	President made a cartel of Duke of Montrose, putting all of President's prisoners from three earlier captures, on board and then sending her and her now 79 passengers and crew into Falmouth under the command of an American officer. There the British government refused to recognize the cartel agreement that Blewett, his crew, and passengers had signed. Rather than turn <bop>Duke<eop> of Montrose over to the Agent for American Prisoners, the British government instructed Blewett to resume command of <bop>his<eop> ship and prepare her to sail again.
False	Clea revealed to the inhabitants of the Dark Dimension that her mother didn't care for her subjects at all and was willing to endanger them to defeat Clea. The population became convinced that Clea should be the ruler and the ``Flames of Regency'' appeared on Clea's head. The Flames of Regency made <bop>Clea<eop> powerful enough to defeat and banish Umar and <bop>her<eop> father Orini from the Dark Dimension, and Clea took the throne of the Dark Dimension.
True	This prompted the release of Brooks' 2013 album, Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences. Following his retirement from the music industry in 2002, Garth Brooks rarely performed outside occasional events, such as a series in Kansas City and benefit concerts in Los Angeles. Despite <bop>his<eop> original intention to remain officially retired until 2014, <bop>Brooks<eop>, along with wife Trisha Yearwood, received an offer from Steve Wynn to perform a residency show at his Encore Theatre in Las Vegas.
False	Three of the more famous horses were world champions. Joe Young (known as the ``iron horse'') sold for $10,000 by C.E. Westbrook, the first horse west of the Mississippi River to sell for such a high price. <bop>Joe Young<eop> sired Joe Patchen in 1889, who earned <bop>his<eop> owner $40,000 in race purses and then was sold for $44,000.
False	Luo is grouped with Wang Bo, Yang Jiong (**/**) and Lu Zhaolin (***/***) as one of the Four Greats of the Early Tang as the most outstanding writers of their time. It was said that Luo Binwang could recite poetry when he was six years old. In adulthood, after a period serving on the staff of Li Yuanqing (***) Prince of <bop>Dao<eop>, an uncle of then-ruling Emperor Gaozong, Luo worked in the central government in Chang'an from 665. In 670, <bop>he<eop> was exiled to Xinjiang, after which he travelled to Yunnan with the army.
True	Bob Todd (1) makes an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in Again Doctor. He also appeared in the 1970 Carry On Again Christmas TV special. <bop>Nikki van der Zyl<eop> (2) was one of British cinema's most prolific voice-over artistes, dubbing many of the original Bond girls (including Shirley Eaton in Goldfinger). <bop>She<eop> appears unaccredited in two of the films, none of them dubbing work.
True	His most memorable role was in Cleo where he played Marcus to Warren Mitchell's Spencius. He had other roles in Spying, Doctor, Henry, Abroad, and Emmannuelle. He also appeared uncredited in Follow That Camel. <bop>Anthony Sagar<eop> (7) had several minor roles from Sergeant to Loving, <bop>his<eop> role in Constable being uncredited.
True	Batholomew agreed that Vitkovic was criminally insane at the time of the shooting and said Vitkovic could have identified with Rambo and the Hoddle Street killings. After hearing representations by counsel representing the building tenants directly affected, the families of those killed, and news media organisations, the coroner <bop>Hal Hallenstein<eop> refused to suppress publication of photographs taken from a 5th-floor security video that showed Vitkovic. <bop>He<eop> said those images would be made public at the end of the inquest.
False	Morey told the show's official website that Sonya entered Callum's life, not to get him back, but to see if he was okay. However, she then fell in love with Toadie. When she was asked how Callum does not remember his mother, <bop>Morey<eop> explained that Sonya had fallen in with a bad crowd and had become addicted to alcohol and drugs, when <bop>she<eop> had Callum.
False	Mainz Cathedral was the coronation site for Philip of Swabia, for Frederick II, and anti-king Henry Raspe. Speyer Cathedral is the world's largest preserved Romanesque church (after the demolition of Cluny Abbey) and today a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built starting about 1025 by King Conrad II as a family vault for the ruling Salian dynasty. <bop>His<eop> successor <bop>Henry III<eop> donated the Speyer Gospels in 1046; the building was completed in 1061 under the rule of King Henry IV. During the Investiture Controversy with Pope Gregory VIII, he had the church again extended from 1081, in order to stress his Imperial authority.
False	Rajkumar plays Dr Murthy, surgeon, who is also a Singer by hobby. On a visit to Ernakulam for a medical conference, Murthy's father advises him to stay at Retd Major subbanna's <bop>Balakrishna<eop> house, who is old-friend. Due to a mishap by <bop>his<eop> assistant, Murthy has to act as compounder and his assistant has to act as Doctor.
False	He was called to the Ontario bar in 1967 and practiced private law at Wright & McTaggart and its successor firms until 1982, at which point he went to work as Associate Deputy Minister of Justice for the Government of Canada. In 1986, he went on to practice at McCarthy T*trault, until he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1998, replacing Justice <bop>John Sopinka<eop>. Just as with <bop>his<eop> predecessor, Binnie had never sat as a judge before his appointment to the Supreme Court.
True	Tiro is dispatched off to meet with Caelius Rufus, who is now working for Crassus, to find out what his plans are. Rufus, who dislikes old baldhead intensely, agrees to hide Tiro in a secret panel behind a tapestry during an important meeting. About twenty important men meet at <bop>Crassus<eop>'' house, including Caesar and Catilina, and on <bop>his<eop> return to Cicero they work together on his transcribed notes, finding out that the conspirators plan to seize control of the state, introduce a land reform bill, sell of vast amounts of conquered land abroad and then annexe Egypt for further acquisition of land in Italy for the plebeians.
False	His sister, Susan Linn Sage (1866--1933) married James Fenimore Cooper (1858--1938), grandson of prolific author James Fenimore Cooper (1789--1851). Susan and James were the parents of <bop>Paul Fenimore Cooper<eop> (1899--1970), an author and Henry's nephew. After graduation from Yale, <bop>he<eop> began working in the lumber business, like his father and grandfather.
False	``Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand: her opponents have observed that in the event of a nuclear war, the two things that will emerge from the rubble are the cockroaches and Helen Clark.'' The Dominion Post reported that <bop>Helen Clark<eop> found the anecdote amusing and suggested Mrs Clinton should talk to <bop>her<eop> husband, former US president Bill Clinton.
False	Her two-day visit to Washington D.C. included a meeting and lunch at the White House with President George W Bush (as well as other senior Bush Administration officials), and meetings with the Secretary of State, <bop>Condoleezza Rice<eop>, the Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, the US Trade Representative, Susan Schwab, and the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Mike McConnell. <bop>She<eop> also made calls on the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Barbara Boxer, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
False	The painting has been described as one of D*rer's most unpopular works, with many art historians, including Max Friedl*nder and Erwin Panofsky, commenting unfavourably on apparent qualities such as ``austerity and awkwardness''. Art historian Fedja Anzelewsky described her as ``a parody rather than an exaltation of the classical feminine figure.'' The feminist scholar <bop>Linda Hults<eop> observes how ``there is a mechanical quality to Lucretia's suicidal gesture; it seems to operate apart from <bop>her<eop> facial expression, and it does not seem to require the assistance of her other arm, which is oddly placed behind her back.''
True	By romanticizing Cort*s as the discoverer of Mexico and the destroyer of Aztec immorality (human sacrifice), Calder*n participates in this initial ``discovery'' herself, ignoring Cort*s'' brutalities of conquest, and mythicizing the Mexican landscape as a Paradise comparable to the Biblical Eden through its sublimity. In doing so, she highlights Mexico's ``unexploited'' resources, which would become part of the motivation for the United States' invasion of Mexico. Despite <bop>her<eop> identification with Cort*s, <bop>Calder*n<eop>'s later description of Chapultepec implies a greater affinity for Cort*s'' indigenous mistress, Malinche or ``Do*a Marina'', who held substantial political authority for a woman of her background.
True	In another version, this transformation happens after the erroneous hymns are rectified and the son is called Ila. According to a variant, Shraddha wished for a daughter; Vashistha heeded her wish while performing the sacrifice and thus, a daughter was born. However, <bop>Manu<eop> desired a son so Vashistha appealed to Vishnu to change the gender of <bop>his<eop> daughter.
False	The Arnold version was the first of three songs through the mid 1950s to spend 21 weeks at No. 1. In 1950, <bop>Hank Snow<eop>'s ``I'm Movin' On'' would match the record, and in 1955, their record would become jointly held by Webb Pierce with <bop>his<eop> cover of Jimmie Rodgers' ``In the Jailhouse Now.''
False	Freeman remained active in her last two years, with a regular voice role on As Told By Ginger, a voice bit in the animated feature film Shrek, a guest appearance on the sitcom Becker and, most notably, scoring a Tony Award nomination and a Theatre World Award for her role of accompanist Jeannette Burmeister in the Broadway musical version of The Full Monty. In <bop>her<eop> final episode of As Told By Ginger, Season 2's ``No Hope For <bop>Courtney<eop>'', Freeman's character, Mrs. Gordon, retires from her teaching job though two of her students try convincing her to return to work.

The New Adventures of <bop>Pippi Longstocking<eop> was released worldwide on DVD in 2000 and re-released as a double feature with the movie Matilda starring Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman in 2007.

True	In 1808, Tucker crafted another piece of proposed legislation that would have greatly reduced the number of mandatory appeals a party was entitled to, both in an effort to reduce the Court of Appeals's caseload and to curtail what Tucker saw as pointless delay tactics by parties that only served to clog the court system. The Virginia Assembly rejected this proposal, along with Tucker's idea of splitting the Court of Appeals into legal and chancery divisions. During <bop>his<eop> tenure, <bop>Tucker<eop> ruled in the notable case of Hudgins v.

False	Despite the subsequent escalation of the conflict, when Medusa learns that the X-Men only attacked now because the Terrigenesis cloud was about to reach the point where it would make the whole planet toxic to mutants, she resolves the situation by destroying the cloud, preventing any further Inhumans from manifesting their powers, feeling that the future of her species is not worth the present loss of mutant life that would result. In the aftermath, she along with <bop>her<eop> sister, <bop>Crystal<eop>, Black Bolt, Flint, Gorgon and Swain, are guided by Noh-Varr to the former Kree throne-world of Hala where he has stated they may discover the origins of Terrigen and in so doing offer a future to their doomed people, however, things are not well for the former Queen as she runs her hand through her powerful hair only to pull a large clump out with it, forcing her to announce to her crew that she is dying.
True	Music writer Ben Sisario described this stance as ``vintage college-rock 'tude--the hit, the pop song, should be avoided as inauthentic, while the aggro, anticommercial song represents legitimacy.'' <bop>Ivo Watts-Russell<eop> stated if Black Francis had been possibly persuaded to release the version of the song recorded during the session for the ``Gigantic'' single--which <bop>he<eop> described as ``totally streamlined and ready for radio''--that ``maybe if a major label company was able to convince people to take a more commercial route, maybe Pixies would have sold a whole bunch more records than they did.

True	Judges rarely second-guess the prosecutors' judgment on such a matter (and George stated that he was ``loath'' to do so). However, George's review of the evidence in the case caused him to feel so strongly that the prosecutors were in error that he did exactly that. <bop>George<eop> reassigned the case to the California Attorney General 's office, and that office successfully convicted Buono on nine of the 10 counts. Thus, it was recognized that the judge, through <bop>his<eop> action to deny the earlier motion to dismiss, had ultimately prevented a serial killer from going free.

False	``A key album in the shift in Pat Martino's sound at the end of the 60s -- with one foot in the soul jazz camp in which he got his start, and the other in the freer, open-minded style he used a lot in the 70s!'' Jazz critic <bop>Scott Yanow<eop> described the album as ``funky in spots, electric, and swinging when called for'' and extols Martino's performance as ``consistently inventive`` ``Even this difficult instrument doesn't dampen <bop>his<eop> proficiency.''

The book has been noted not only for its defence of <bop>Scott<eop> but for the stridency of its attacks on Huntford, which Fiennes claimed would have gone considerably further, had the laws of libel allowed. Fiennes, who has apparently studied how the great explorers of <bop>his<eop> own generation came to be sidelined, later described Scott as ``a great historic hero whose name has been dragged through the dirt.''
True	Barrett returned onscreen in November at the pre-show of Survivor Series. On the 29 December 2014 episode of Raw, Barrett returned to action and defeated Cesaro. On the 5 January 2015 episode of Raw, <bop>Barrett<eop> defeated Dolph Ziggler in a 2-out-of-3 falls match to capture <bop>his<eop> fifth Intercontinental Championship.
False	According to Burgundian sources, he concluded the speech by telling the English longbowmen that the French had boasted that they would cut off two fingers from the right hand of every archer, so they could never draw a string again. In <bop>Shakespeare<eop>'s account, King Henry begins <bop>his<eop> speech in response to Westmorland's expressions of dismay at the English army's lack of troop strength.
False	The league released Owens to satisfy the Pirates owner, and Owens worked in the International League (the renamed Eastern League) in 1913 before returning to the American Association in 1914--1915. American League president Ban Johnson hired him for the 1916 season, one year after the death of umpire Jack Sheridan. After <bop>his<eop> minor league experiences, the relatively calm environment cultivated by <bop>Johnson<eop> was a relief, and Owens only had few notable confrontations before retiring due to illness after 22 AL seasons.
False	A popular hypothesis is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time. The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like Cailleach figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. <bop>Margaret Murray<eop> proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in <bop>her<eop> essay, ``The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts'', ``I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect...''
True	I've always said there are a lot of great middle relievers out there who deserve to go to the game. I think they're overlooked a little bit. It's amazing to be selected, an overwhelming feeling.'' <bop>Meek<eop> is the first Pirate reliever selected who was not a closer since Mace Brown in 1938 -- before the closer position emerged. The Pirates celebrated <bop>his<eop> nomination at PNC Park with an 8--5 victory over the visiting Philadelphia Phillies, a game where Meek was the winning pitcher.
True	Rodrigo Dorfman (born 1967 in Santiago, Chile) is a multimedia filmmaker.

True	His entrance music was of the techno genre, which was popular in some American and German dance clubs at the time, and he often danced as he walked to the ring or once he got in the ring. His first feud was with Jean-Paul Levesque, whom he defeated at Starrcade in December in both men's pay-per-view debut. In <bop>his<eop> early career, <bop>Wright<eop> went undefeated in matches against several WCW superstars including Bobby Eaton in January 1995 at Clash of the Champions and Paul Roma at SuperBrawl V in February of '95.
False	Lawrence was released from his contract after two years with Swansea City on May 4, with his former loan employers Crewe Alexandra interested in a permanent move. In September 2009 He signed a deal to play for San Juan Jabloteh in his native Trinidad. On 18 March 2010 Wrexham manager <bop>Dean Saunders<eop> revealed that Lawrence was training at <bop>his<eop> former club along with fellow former Swansea player Kristian O'Leary.
False	With Breton she had a daughter, Aube Ell*ou*t Breton. She and Breton separated in 1943. Lamba later married David Hare, an American sculptor.

For the last five years of <bop>her<eop> life, Lamba suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
True	Strand Johansen, who was the main organizer of NKP's election campaign in 1949, was central also in the internal conflict that ensued and headed the faction that opposed Peder Furubotn -- the ``L*vlien faction'' as it was named after party chairman Emil L*vlien. In the book Fiendebilde Wollweber (Enemy picture Wollweber) by Norwegian historian Lars Borgersrud, Strand Johansen is portrayed as a vitriolic opponent of the Furubotn faction. The conflict climaxed on October 26, 1949 when <bop>Strand Johansen<eop> together with five or more people showed up in the party offices in Klingenberggata 4 and kicked out Furubotn's supporters. The purge began six days prior when <bop>he<eop> had initiated the move against Furubotn at a meeting of trustees of the Oslo party, levelling against the supporters of Peder Furubotn fierce accusations of factionalism and of having set up an illegitimate party leadership -- ``the second center''.
False	He soonafter became first choice left back at the club citing Brazilian full back Maicon as inspiration for taking up his new position, saying ``I watched the World Cup and saw the way guys like Maicon were bombing forward - and I thought ''I can do that``. He opened his scoring account for the season on 22 January away to Blackpool scoring two goals in the first half. After deploying him in an attacking role, Sunderland manager <bop>Steve Bruce<eop> hailed Richardson's versatility saying ''I must have asked <bop>him<eop> to play in five or six positions this season and certainly in that position he enjoys it, it's something he revels in``.
True	Katie Sketch is now performing with Gentleman Reg and has been seen in some shows at the Gladstone Hotel and the Beaver in Toronto, Ontario.

False	He scored on his debut, netting the first and third goals in a 4--0 victory over Rotherham United. Chopra then would score in consecutive matches against Blackpool, Plymouth Argyle, Bristol City and Bristol Rovers. In the post-match ceremony, manager <bop>Dave Jones<eop> commented, ``Chopra is on fire, <bop>he<eop>'s scored seven goals already and he's shown he will get the goals if he gets the supply''.
False	One rainy day, married actors Rena Leslie (Lee Patrick) and Clayton Evans (John Emery) seek shelter from the downpour. <bop>Madge<eop> falls in love with Clayton and plans to run away with him, abandoning Rena. Bill suspects Connie of infidelity with local antiques dealer Jeff Douglas (Harvey Stephens), and confronts <bop>her<eop>.
False	Roger Abbott and Luba Goy began the show with a brief history of the show, closing with ``the scariest three words on television: AIR FARCE LIVE!''. After this experimental episode, CBC announced that the 15th season of the series would be aired live for the entire season, with a name change to Air Farce Live. With the new live format, <bop>Penelope Corrin<eop>, who filled in for Holmes during <bop>her<eop> pregnancy in early 2007, officially joined the troupe, increasing its number to seven.
False	Though several characters comment on the peculiarity of having a female coach for a baseball team, Momoe is shown to be competent in the role. Momoe has a small dog named Ai who accompanies the team to practice, including practice games with other teams. Momoe's voice actress is <bop>Risa Hayamizu<eop>, while Cynthia Cranz provides <bop>her<eop> voice in English.
True	In 2012, she was selected to drive the North American Eagle Project jet car in which she will be attempting to break the land speed record for a woman (currently 512 mph). <bop>Valerie<eop> was later removed from this project and replaced by a different female rider, Jessi Combs. This began the downward spiral of <bop>her<eop> career, including the loss of Harley Davidson and Monster Energy as race sponsors.
False	Tahu ended his season by playing for the New Zealand M*ori against England. After the tumultuous 2010 season, Tahu requested an extended break from the Eels pre-season training, hoping to return in January 2011. New coach <bop>Stephen Kearney<eop> denied the request and Tahu was released from <bop>his<eop> contract.
False	Among his pupils was the American soprano Geraldine Farrar. He died on June 30, 1901 at his birthplace, Fermo, in Italy. During his career, Graziani had faced strong competition on stage from a number of other outstanding Italian baritones. Probably the greatest of <bop>his<eop> immediate rivals was Roman-born <bop>Antonio Cotogni<eop>, whose voice was of similar quality and range to Graziani's.
False	In <bop>her<eop> early years in New York City, following the <bop>Whitney<eop> fellowship, Tancons worked as a personal assistant and curatorial research assistant for artist Coco Fusco on the landmark exhibition Only Skin Deep: Changing Visions of the American Self (2003).
False	In her early years in New York City, following the <bop>Whitney<eop> fellowship, Tancons worked as a personal assistant and curatorial research assistant for artist Coco Fusco on the landmark exhibition Only Skin Deep: Changing Visions of the American Self (2003). <bop>She<eop> also became involved with Lorna Simpson, with the artist featuring Tancons in her video work 31 (2002).
True	In the third round Peng came face to face with another former world number 1, Maria Sharapova, which Peng managed to win in straight sets 6--2 6--4. In the quarterfinals, <bop>Peng<eop> lost to Nadia Petrova, winning the first set 7--65, but then started to feel pains in <bop>her<eop> leg, losing the next two sets 3--6, 2--6.
False	An elder brother introduced her to jazz, Cook chose voice as her instrument of choice, and she became a disciple of jazz icon Eddie Jefferson, founder of a singing technique called 'vocalese' where a singer sings lyrics to a famous instrumental solo. During this time she and close friend <bop>Regina Carter<eop> formed dreams of becoming jazz musicians; Cook as a singer, and Carter as a violinist. At Carter's urging <bop>she<eop> applied to and was accepted by Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.
False	Talbot slips out of the General's house and travels to an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, searching it for signs of something out of the ordinary. Upon his return he finds Royale and <bop>Larry<eop> burying something in the grounds of the General's house. After they have finished <bop>he<eop> discovers that they were burying Jablonski's body and, now needing another ally, persuades Ruthven's chauffeur to help him.
False	In addition to reality television Lavendeira has guest starred as himself in scripted shows such as Privileged. Hilton is also a regular on TV Series TRL, MuchMusic, and Extra where he appears via satellite from his closet studio to talk about gossip. He co-hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards and after Rick Astley did not show up to collect <bop>his<eop> award for best act ever at the MTV Europe Music Awards, <bop>Perez Hilton<eop> collected the prize on Rick's behalf.
False	He was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by attorneys for Irish actor Colin Farrell on July 18, 2005, after posting a link to Farrell's sex tape with then-girlfriend <bop>Nicole Narain<eop> on his site and on February 20, 2007, a lawsuit filed against him by Universal City Studios Productions LLP for posting a topless image of actress Jennifer Aniston that was allegedly ``misappropriated and illegally copied'' from unreleased footage from <bop>her<eop> 2006 motion picture The Break-Up.
False	Therapy proves useless and Jane and Taylor still continue to see each other, even going as far as sneaking out to a gay bar, which Jane gets grounded for when she comes home at 4 AM. Janice, meanwhile, goes to her two close friends to talk about the situation. Despite both her friends saying that <bop>Janice<eop> should accept Jane for who <bop>she<eop> is, as it is a mother's duty to love her child, Janice refuses to as she believes Jane is ruining her life.

True	He has played 45 matches for Faroe Islands national football team and is currently (2012) number two on the top goal scorer's list with 9 goals. <bop>J*nsson<eop> is the most scoring foreign football player in the Danish Superliga (Premier League) with 72 goals. <bop>He<eop> was previously top scorer for FC K*benhavn at all times together with Lars H*jer Nielsen, they both scored 54 goals for FCK, but they have later been surpassed by Cesar Santin and Dame N'Doye.

False	``(I)t was clearly a tactical ...a racist scheme of using Black and <bop>Latino<eop> and Asian people to do the bidding of one man, namely Fred Newman, that's my opinion, and to use other whites as well, you know through the therapy practices.'' After <bop>he<eop> raised his concerns internally, Serrette said his treatment by other NAP leaders worsened dramatically.
True	Fulani was a guest researcher at Rockefeller University from 1973--1977, with a focus on how learning and social environment interact for African-American youth. While in college, she became involved in black nationalist politics, along with her then-husband Richard. Both had adopted the name of the West African people Fulani as a surname when they married in a traditional West African ceremony. During <bop>her<eop> studies at City University, <bop>Fulani<eop> became interested in the work of Fred Newman and Lois Holzman, who had recently formed the New York Institute for Social Therapy and Research.
False	Newman developed the theory and practice of Social Therapy in the 1970s, founding the New York Institute for Social Therapy in 1977. Along with psychologist <bop>Lois Holzman<eop>, Fulani has worked to incorporate the social therapeutic approach into youth-oriented programs, most notably the New York City-based All Stars Project, which <bop>she<eop> co-founded in 1981.
False	He and <bop>Carrie<eop>'s older sister Connie, a bossy blonde a year his senior, often hide during hide-and-seek games in tall grass where they spend the time talking with each other, though they have little in common. Connie asks him to the movies, but he sits away from <bop>her<eop> when he spots boys from his school; he fears he will be teased for being on a date.
False	Cacique is a full-brother to Breeders' Cup winners Banks Hill and Intercontinental and to Grade One winner Champs Elysees and Grade One-placed and Leading sire in France, Dansili. Ridden in his first six starts by American Hall of Fame jockey, <bop>Gary Stevens<eop>, Cacique was trained at the Chantilly stables of Andre Fabre.

True	Army hosted Vince Lombardi's former team, the Fordham Rams at Michie Stadium. One of the members of the Rams was Vince's brother, Joe Lombardi, who transferred to the school after Lombardi left. <bop>Tim Cohane<eop>, writer of Look Magazine was a Fordham alumnus, and a friend of Army coach Red Blaik. <bop>He<eop> pressured both teams to play each other.
False	In Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Lucy is played by Sadie Frost. Lucy is eroticized much further than her literary incarnation, becoming more than seductive and coquettish, even tempting, and what she says often refers to sex. As a spoiled child of aristocracy, she talks with artlessness and frankness, bordering on the indecent. Unlike <bop>her<eop> friend <bop>Mina<eop>, who stays resolute, Lucy's sexual tendencies are to be her downfall.
False	Hazzard picked up the guitar and ukulele at a young age, but managed to miss out on the Merseybeat skiffle scene that engulfed the region in the early 1960s, focusing instead on his education at Durham University. Through a mutual friend he was introduced to BBC story editor Tony Garnett. <bop>Garnett<eop> persuaded Hazzard to move to London to pursue <bop>his<eop> songwriting ambitions.
False	Her first mission as senior agent comes in season 3 episode 2, when she and new agent Steve Jinks are sent to snag Typhoid Mary 'ss knife. During the events of Warehouse 2's reactivation in season 2 episode 11, Mrs. <bop>Frederic<eop> explains to Claudia that everyone at the Warehouse has a purpose, and that <bop>she<eop> has to be prepared.
True	Upon Artie's return to the Warehouse, Mrs. Frederic tells him that Claudia could pose a threat to the Warehouse and that he must deal with her, telling him ``You know the options.'' Given <bop>Claudia<eop>'s technological aptitude and ingenuity, and some convincing from Leena, Artie opts to offer <bop>her<eop> a job at the Warehouse, which she readily accepts.
False	By late 1973, Donovan abandoned the style of glam rock featured on his Cosmic Wheels album earlier that year. <bop>Andrew Loog Oldham<eop> was brought in (replacing Mickie Most) to co-produce Donovan's next album, which would highlight the subdued style of <bop>his<eop> previous work.
False	This change in language was provided in the 1957 Act; the old language was considered anachronistic, as since the 1870s Britain had employed the ``long-drop'' method of hanging, which was held to cause near-instantaneous death. Simcox's date of execution was set for Tuesday 17 March 1964 at Winson Green Prison, Birmingham . However, his lawyers petitioned the Home Secretary, <bop>Henry Brooke<eop>, on the grounds that Simcox was still severely injured from <bop>his<eop> self-inflicted wounds, could not walk, and would probably have to be hanged in a wheelchair .
False	Emperor Zhaozong thus renamed Shannan East to Zhongyi (meaning ``faithful and righteous'') and made Zhao its military governor as well as the deputy commander of the overall operations against Qin (with Zhu being the commander). After Qin was deposed by <bop>his<eop> own officers and delivered to <bop>Zhu<eop> (and eventually delivered to the imperial capital Chang'an to be executed in spring 889), Zhao was given the honorary chancellor designation of Zhongshu Ling (***) and was created the Prince of Huai'an.
False	The EP was released in April 2006 in North America through Deep Elm Records as an extended mini-album. During 2003, when Charlie Simpson was still an active member of successful pop trio Busted, he met fellow songwriter-guitarist <bop>Alex Westaway<eop> and drummer Omar Abidi at a party. <bop>He<eop> was by this stage becoming increasingly frustrated by the music he was performing in Busted and stated he had ``all of this creativity pent up inside and I just needed to vent it somewhere, and I was writing a lot of songs but I couldn't play them, because I didn't have anyone to play them with''.
True	This CD focuses on Brazilian Samba and Bossa Nova styles and was recorded with an ensemble setting. Here Kirtley's sound comes from the nylon-string guitar instead of his usual steel-string. Through this period, <bop>Kirtley<eop> also released a number of video projects, including three instructional titles for Stefan Grossman 's Guitar Workshop, as well as producing a number of videos on other artists. In 1999 <bop>he<eop> released the video Nine Pound Hammer:
True	When she was three years old, Denise and her family moved to Los Angeles from New York, where her father Gene Di Novi - a musician - made music for the TV shows of Danny Thomas, Dick Van Dyke and Andy Griffith. Prior to that, Gene worked with Doris Day, Lena Horne and Peggy Lee. In the late 1960s, the family moved again, this time to Toronto in Canada, and while there <bop>Denise<eop>'s mother, Patricia, died of cancer. <bop>She<eop> has two sons, Mac and Nicholas, and she is married to film director Christopher Taylor.
True	In between the two latter films, Jones played Mr. Mertle in The Sandlot (1993), a role he reprised again in The Sandlot 2 (2005); and voiced the character of Mufasa in the 1994 animated Disney film The Lion King, he voiced that character again in the sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998). Although uncredited, Jones' voice is possibly heard as Vader at the conclusion of Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith (2005). When specifically asked whether <bop>he<eop> had supplied the voice, possibly from a previous recording, <bop>Jones<eop> told Newsday: ``You'd have to ask Lucas about that.
False	When Trapper and Hawkeye get back to the 4077th, they have Borelli paged to the OR and the two surgeons scrub in. Radar comes into the OR, looking upset and urges <bop>Hawkeye<eop> to go to the Swamp, where Borelli waits. In the Swamp Borelli sits with a scared, somber expression on <bop>his<eop> face, and Hawkeye realizes that the surgeon is drunk and unfit to operate.
True	He moved to Adrian, Michigan in October 1836. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate from the 2nd district, 1839 to 1840 and later from the 3rd district, 1842 to 1843. <bop>Greenly<eop> served as the fifth Lieutenant Governor from 1846 to 1847 and became Governor on March 4, 1847 after the resignation of Alpheus Felch to take a seat in the U.S. Senate. <bop>He<eop> completed Felch's term through January 3, 1848.
False	Hungarian sources from 1288 make notice of one Russian named Ivan (Iwan dicto Oroz) as an ally of the ban of Severin, Theodore Vejtehi from the kindred Csan*d, who was one of the nobles that opposed the rule of Charles I of Hungary in 1316--1317. The land to the south of Severin was governed for Bulgaria by the despot of Vidin, Michael Shishman, a supporter of Vejtehi. Thus, as the Hungarian king established <bop>his<eop> authority over <bop>Severin<eop> and suppressed Vejtehi's rebellion, Ivan the Russian may have fled to Vidin and entered the service of Michael Shishman.
False	Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks her to come back to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she will not come back because she does not feel she will be forgiven. Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and <bop>Susan<eop>, who comfort Katherine and say they will try to forgive <bop>her<eop>.
True	DeAnn Welker of MSNBC complimented the Katherine homecoming, and said the best line of the episode was Karen McCluskey's response when Katherine rejected visitors: ``Who says I'm visiting? Maybe I'm bonkers too.'' <bop>Welker<eop>, however, was critical of the subplot between Gaby and Susan, who <bop>she<eop> said were ``stuck in storylines-that-don't-matter territory.''
True	This service recounts the Harrowing of Hell, at which time, according to Orthodox theology, the righteous dead were raised from Hades and entered into Paradise. This Good News of <bop>Christ<eop>'s triumph over death, the Church teaches, was at that time revealed only to the departed. The revelation to the living occurred when <bop>his<eop> tomb was found empty ``very early in the morning, on the first day of the week'' (Mark 16:2) and this vigil recounts that discovery of the empty tomb.
True	Lancelot, at the end of his own life, will be buried next to Galehaut in the magnificent tomb that the younger man had built to consecrate and eternalize their companionship. Since the early thirteenth century, there have been numerous retellings, in various languages, of the life and loves and chivalric career of <bop>Lancelot<eop>. The story of <bop>his<eop> adulterous liaison with Guinevere has always been part of every significant account of King Arthur.
False	He was the second son of King John of Saxony (1801--1873) and his wife Princess Amelia of Bavaria (1801--1877), daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria (1756--1825). On 11 May 1859 at Bel*m Palace, Lisbon, George married the younger sister of King Pedro V of Portugal: The <bop>Infanta Maria Anna<eop> of Portugal, eldest surviving daughter of Queen Maria II of Portugal and <bop>her<eop> consort Prince Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koh*ry.
True	And since the Emperor took an oath (Book III) when he becomes Sultan to spread the faith of Islam by conquest, the threat of persecution or martyrdom for Christians was real. <bop>Henry VIII<eop> was directly responsible for Thomas More's tribulation when <bop>he<eop> wrote the Dialogue in the tower.
False	When he learns about his daughter's career with the Arrow, he attempts to convince her to join forces with him, but he is ultimately arrested by <bop>Donna<eop>'s current romantic interest, police captain Quentin Lance, when Felicity decides that no matter what he claims he will never be anything more than a criminal that <bop>she<eop> can never trust.
True	He is hunted down by Danny Brickwell and Michael Amar because he is the only one who can disable the nukes that Darhk has launched, forcing Team Arrow to rescue him and recruit his assistance in disabling the nuclear missiles, although his best efforts are only able to stop the missiles after one missile is launched and redirect that missile to a relatively small town. Before teaming up with <bop>her<eop> father to stop the missiles, <bop>Donna<eop> revealed to Felicity that Noah didn't abandon them; rather, Donna and Felicity left Noah after Donna discovered his life of crime, not wanting their daughter to be corrupted.
False	He was also included in the 40-strong preliminary England World Cup squad for the 1982 finals; however, he was not picked in the final 22. His promising Villa career was effectively ended after sustaining a knee injury in an away game at Nottingham Forest. After a heavy tackle, he was helped to his feet by <bop>Ian Bowyer<eop> and, in Shaw's words, something in <bop>his<eop> knee 'clicked'.
True	Returning to the Oc*anic for the 2004--05 season, Crosby continued dominating the league, leading the league with 66 goals, 102 assists and 168 points over 62 games to capture his second consecutive Beliveau Trophy. Joining Crosby on Rimouski's top line were wingers Dany Roussin and Marc-Antoine Pouliot, who finished second and third in league-scoring with 116 and 114 points, respectively. In addition to <bop>his<eop> scoring title, <bop>Crosby<eop> was once again named Most Valuable Player, Offensive Player and Personality of the Year honours, while repeating as a QMJHL First All-Star.
True	Petersburg in 1842, Semyon Gulak-Artemovsky became a soloist of the Imperial Opera at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, a position he held for 22 years. In 1852 and 1853 he sang roles in Anton Rubinstein's first two operas, Dmitry Donskoy and Fomka the Fool. Gulak-Artemovsky performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow from 1864 to 1865. He performed over fifty operatic roles during <bop>his<eop> career, including <bop>Ruslan<eop> in Glinka's Ruslan and Lyudmila, Masetto in Mozart's Don Giovanni, as well as Antonio and Lord Ashton in Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix and Lucia di Lammermoor.
False	In 1997 the two reunited after Kristen's lies were revealed and John asked Marlena to marry him. However, the wedding was interrupted when Kristen came in with Marlena's ex-husband Roman, who was believed to be dead. Roman returned to Salem and <bop>Kristen<eop> had told him that he and Marlena were still married and John and <bop>her<eop> were a couple.
True	At Belle's christening, Roman found out about John and Marlena's affair, and was furious. Marlena found out that Sami had switched Belle's paternity test, and John was actually Belle's father. Marlena moved out with Belle, and she and Roman divorced. John provided <bop>Marlena<eop> and Belle a place to stay while <bop>she<eop> was working out the divorce.
False	Hay-Webster admitted that she previously had dealings with Bennett's followers, and expressed confidence that she could win back their support, but denied that she had any dealings with Bennett himself. However, in later years she crossed party lines to work with fellow woman politician and neighbouring South East St. Catherine MP <bop>Olivia Grange<eop>, successfully reducing gang violence. In <bop>her<eop> re-election campaign for the 2007 elections, Hay-Webster faced off against Devon McDaniel, a JLP member who had formerly represented the South Trelawny constituency but withdrew from politics in 2005, only to announce in February 2007 that he would stand against Hay-Webster for the St. Catherine seat instead.
False	Michael Farr, author of Tintin: The Complete Companion, notes: ``Whereas Herg* kept Tintin's facial expressions to a bare minimum ... Haddock's could be contorted with emotion.'' <bop>Farr<eop> goes on to write that ``In Haddock, Herg* had come up with <bop>his<eop> most inspired character since creating Tintin'' and sales of the volume in which Haddock was introduced indicated the character was well received.
False	This was erected 195 years after Shahul's era. As a mark of respect people also Venerate the sandals of the saint which are preserved in the shrine. The central part of the dargah is the tomb of the saint, Shahul Hamid, who is a direct descendant of Mohammed, through <bop>his<eop> grandson <bop>Hassan<eop>, through Abdel Khader Gilani, Sultanul Awliya, and approached through seven thresholds (four made of silver and three of gold).
False	Angerer was Germany's second choice goalkeeper behind Silke Rottenberg for almost a decade, winning six major titles as a reserve player without having played in a single game, including the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, two Olympic bronze medals in 2000, 2004, and three UEFA European Championships in 1997, 2001 and 2005.

False	One can't judge his accomplishments by his list of wins because World War II interrupted his career just as World War I interrupted that of Philippe Thys. Coppi won it all: the world hour record, the world championships, the grands tours, classics as well as time trials.

LeBron James and Kyrie Irving would each score 41 points in Game 5 to give the Cavaliers a 112--97 win in Game 5 and keep them alive in the NBA Finals. LeBron James would keep <bop>his<eop> dominance going through Game 6 with a 41-point performance to give the Cavaliers a 115--101 win over the Warriors. in Game 7, with 1:50 remaining in the game, <bop>LeBron James<eop> blocked Andre Iguodala's potential go-ahead layup to keep the game tied at 89--89 and then Kyrie Irving hit a three-pointer with less than a minute remaining to put the Cavaliers ahead 92--89.
False	Bentley, while suffering severe debilitation, was not insane.

False	In October 1895 a young seminarian and subdeacon of the White Fathers, Abb* Belli*re, asked the Carmel of Lisieux for a nun who would support -- by prayer and sacrifice -- his missionary work, and the souls that were in the future to be entrusted to him. <bop>Mother Agnes<eop> designated Th*r*se. <bop>She<eop> never met Father Belli*re but ten letters passed between them.
False	Ignacio Ellacur*a, S.J. (Portugalete, Biscay, Spain, 9 November 1930 -- San Salvador, 16 November 1989) was a Roman Catholic Jesuit priest, philosopher, and theologian.

False	She was seriously wounded when she was shot three times attempting to burn down houses on Harcourt Street to try to cut off the retreat of British soldiers who had planted a machine gun post on the roof of the University Church. <bop>Nora Connolly<eop> describes Skinnider's leading role in this action; In <bop>her<eop> autobiography ``Doing my bit for Ireland'' (New York -- Century, 1917) Skinnider herself vividly describes her role as a sniper at St. Stephen's Green in the Easter Rising:
False	In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the medial graph of plane graph G is another graph M(G) that represents the adjacencies between edges in the faces of G. Medial graphs were introduced in 1922 by <bop>Ernst Steinitz<eop> to study combinatorial properties of convex polyhedra, although the inverse construction was already used by Peter Tait in 1877 in <bop>his<eop> foundational study of knots and links.
False	Australia replied with 491 when they batted; Verity took four for 78 in 53*overs and was able to prevent the batsmen scoring quickly. The match was eventually drawn. <bop>Cardus<eop>, in criticising the English bowlers in the game, wrote: ``Verity is apparently the only England bowler in existence at the present time--and <bop>he<eop> is not subtle on a hard wicket.''
True	Bourke described him as ``a fair, rather good-looking, slim man'' who was shabbily dressed in ``an undress general's uniform with a large sword clanking by his side'' and thin old button boots ``which were rather trying to his poor feet on the rocks.'' A few months later, after <bop>his<eop> capture, <bop>Kirkham<eop> was seen by the former Confederate General William Loring, who had taken service with the Egyptians, and described as ``utterly used up by disease and dissipation'', wearing an ancient and much-patched British military uniform, and being very indignant that his nationality and British passport were being ignored.

False	Notably, he totaled five rushing touchdowns in the season, the most by an SDSU quarterback since 1981. Russell began the 1998 year as the team's starting QB, but he struggled early in the season and was replaced by JUCO transfer Jack Hawley.

False	The years following <bop>Selfe<eop>'s address saw more rapid advancements in mobile technologies, social media, and Web 2.0, creating even more new venues of composing for teachers to pay attention to. In <bop>her<eop> own CCCC Chair's Address in 2004, Kathleen Blake Yancey cited these new venues in her argument for a ``new curriculum for the 21st century,'' one that would bring ``together the writing outside of school and that inside.''
True	However, Markbreit became confused by the similar design of both sides of the coin: one side had two helmets and the other side showed two players holding helmets. Thus, he incorrectly thought ``heads'' had landed. When Markbreit became confused, NBC Sports play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg ordered his producer to cut off the microphones surrounding midfield and pull away from the tight shot involving <bop>Markbreit<eop>, Kuechenburg and Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann. After a short discussion with <bop>his<eop> head linesman, Dale Hamer, Markbreit corrected his mistake before the kickoff.
False	Sektor did not appear in the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, which instead saw Smoke utilizing his chest missiles during a fight scene with Liu Kang.

False	Later, he appeared on General Hospital playing mobster and FBI informant Roy DiLucca from 1999 to 2002. 3 During his time with General Hospital, he was awarded three consecutive ALMA Awards from 2000 to 2002. Since <bop>his<eop> resemblance to <bop>Asher Brauner<eop> was very close, Martinez's Roy flashbacks were never re-filmed, although many other character re-casts's flashbacks are filmed.
False	Rutte said that placement of a child in a foster family always involves trying to match the child's background to that of the foster family. Failing that, the interest of the child comes first, and no distinction is made on the basis of religion or sexual orientation. <bop>Erdo*an<eop> intended to turn to the European Court of Human Rights to enforce Yunus to be reunited with <bop>his<eop> biological parents.
False	The success of fellow East Coast act The Notorious B.I.G. at the awards show sent a message to Nas to change his commercial approach, resulting in his hiring of Steve ``The Commissioner'' Stoute as manager.

While <bop>Lennon<eop> was in Spain filming How I Won the War in September 1966, Harrison and Boyd flew to Bombay as guests of sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, and returned to London on 23*October 1966. Through <bop>her<eop> interest in Eastern mysticism and her membership in the Spiritual Regeneration Movement, she inspired all four Beatles to meet the Indian mystic Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London on 24*August 1967, which resulted in a visit to Bangor, Gwynedd, to join him again in the following day.
False	Influenced from the mid-nineties by the works of Imi Knoebel, <bop>Agnes Martin<eop> and Ad Reinhardt, Hannah Maybank uses both construction and destruction to create works which echo our relationship to time and the natural world. The cycles within life, both birth and decay, are reflected by the process in which <bop>her<eop> paintings are made: layers upon layers of latex and acrylic paint are built up to be then stripped, cut and peeled away to reveal both the composition and lifespan of the piece.
False	When Hawke's force was driven off station by a storm, the French fleet under Hubert de Brienne, Comte de Conflans, took advantage and left port. On 20 November 1759 he followed the French warships and during a gale he won a sufficient victory in the Battle of Quiberon Bay, when combined with <bop>Edward Boscawen<eop> 's victory at Lagos, to remove the French invasion threat. Although <bop>he<eop> had effectively put the French channel fleet out of action for the remainder of the war, Hawke was disappointed he had not secured a more comprehensive victory asserting that had he had two more hours of daylight the whole enemy fleet would have been taken.
False	In the latter game against the touring New Zealanders, themselves making their first tour of England, he made 73 and 60 (by some distance the highest scores of his career). He brought off only one catch in first-class cricket, to dismiss <bop>Bob Wyatt<eop> in the derby against Warwickshire.

False	Before long, Joe and the Goodmans have joined forces, Joe has begun courting Winnifred, and all the cowboys in Stetson City have transferred their loyalty to the cathedral-like God Bless Kolaloka Saloon (``Ariz*na, to je prav*ch mu** z*na'').

False	Their plan begins with <bop>Hogofogo<eop>, now disguised as a blind piano tuner (``Hor*c*v poh*ebn* blues''), kidnapping Winnifred as a bait to lure Joe to Dead Man's Valley (``Balada Mexico Kida''). There, the Badmans' henchmen, led by Grimpo, capture <bop>him<eop> and torture him, but Lou has a change of heart and saves his life again, reuniting him with Winnifred.

False	In 1086, and after six years of marriage, Duchess Judith gave birth a son, the future Boles*aw III Wrymouth. This event changed Zbigniew's situation drastically. Now with a legitimate son and heir, both <bop>Zbigniew<eop>'s and Mieszko's positions were threatened by Duke W*adys*aw I. In the case of Mieszko, <bop>he<eop> was forced to accept the situation due to the popularity of the latter among the nobility; however, in 1089 the Mieszko died under mysterious circumstances, probably by poisoning.
False	The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 31*2 stars stating ``Meaning and Mystery is yet another album in the Douglas catalog that showcases his fine compositional and arrangement abilities, but more than this, it's the sound of a group in the process of continued restless development long after the bandmembers have found their collective voice''.

False	An enormous party ensues, where everyone sings ``It's All Too Much'' with everyone living happily ever after.

False	The Council accused prosperity theology of taking passages out of context to fulfill its own needs, with the result that doctrine of positive confession is contradictory to the holistic message of the Bible. In 2015, well known pastor and prosperity gospel advocate, <bop>Creflo Dollar<eop> launched a fundraising campaign to replace a previous private jet with a $65 million dollar Gulfstream G650. On the August 16, 2015 episode of <bop>his<eop> HBO weekly series Last Week Tonight, John Oliver satirized prosperity theology by announcing that he had established his own tax-exempt church, called Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption.
False	He also argues that the proponents of the doctrine misconstrue the atonement, criticizing their teaching that Jesus' death took away poverty as well as sin. He believes that this teaching is drawn from a misunderstanding of Jesus' life and criticizes John Avanzini's teaching that <bop>Jesus<eop> was wealthy as a misrepresentation, noting that Paul often taught Christians to give up their material possessions. Although <bop>he<eop> accepts giving as ``praiseworthy'', he questions the motives of prosperity theology and criticizes the ``Law of Compensation'', which teaches that when Christians give generously, God will give back more in return.
False	The announcement caused controversy within the family; before making their romantic involvement known, Brown had referred to Gordon as her ``big brother.

False	In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, music critic <bop>Lester Bangs<eop> called Hot August Night a ``fine presentation of the entire spectrum'' of Diamond's work and praised its music as ``great, pretentious, goofy pop'' with a melodramatic, ``hymn-like feeling''.

True	Sima Shi, however, had a serious eye illness that was aggravated by the campaign, and he died less than a month later. At that time, Sima Zhao was with his brother at Xuchang (in modern Xuchang, Henan). The 14-year-old emperor <bop>Cao Mao<eop> made an effort to regain imperial power. <bop>He<eop> issued an edict which, under the rationale that Sima Shi had just defeated Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin's rebellion and that the southeastern empire was still not complete pacified, ordered Sima Zhao to remain at Xuchang and that Sima Shi's assistant Fu Jia return to Luoyang with the main troops.
False	During the next few years, he was involved in commanding forces in repelling invasions by Shu's commander of the armed forces, Jiang Wei. In 254, while Sima Zhao was at the capital Luoyang, advisors to the <bop>Wei<eop> emperor Cao Fang suggested that the emperor surprise Sima Zhao and kill <bop>him<eop> to seize his troops, and then use those troops against Sima Shi.

False	Stjepan also gained employment as an assistant to the director of the local community health center in order to provide an income for his wife and daughters.

True	Indeed, Bliss believes Coriolanus may have been the King's Men's debut play at the theatre. Taylor believes that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring 1608. In his 1994 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, R.B. Parker dates the play mid-1608. In <bop>his<eop> 2000 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, <bop>Lee Bliss<eop> is unconvinced by the arguments that Shakespeare is referring to the freezing of the Thames or to Myddelton's scheme, and settles on a date of late 1608 to early 1609.
True	Hackenbush is saved by Stuffy and Tony, who pose as house detectives and then as paperhangers, who first paste the vamp to the wall behind layers of wallpaper and then hide her under the sofa cushions. Next, <bop>Whitmore<eop> brings in the eminent Dr. Steinberg (Sig Ruman) from Vienna, whom <bop>he<eop> hopes will expose Hackenbush as a quack.
False	Tony raises some money by scamming Hackenbush in the ``Tutsi Fruitsy Ice Cream'' scene, in which Tony gives Hackenbush a tip on a horse, but all in code, so that Hackenbush has to buy book after book from Tony to decipher the code. At the Sanitarium, <bop>Judy<eop>'s business manager, Whitmore (Leonard Ceeley) -- who is also Morgan's stooge -- suspects Hackenbush is a fraud and attempts to expose him and rattle Mrs. Upjohn's faith in him by having <bop>her<eop> discover him in a compromising situation with a blonde floozie (Esther Muir).

False	Piggy surprises everyone by being the only girl to join Chadwick and Shayne in the final jump. Though she initially struggles, she finally summons the bravery and makes the leap.

True	Chadwick has a heart-to-heart with Piggy and brings up the issues expressed by the other cast members, which upsets her. A night out at the club causes a humorous situation for Kefla as an old woman hits on him. <bop>Piggy<eop> begins to have issues with Christina, who <bop>she<eop> feels she bonded with initially yet now constantly disregards her.
False	As described in Smithsonian Magazine, ``In 1907 during spring training in Augusta, Georgia, a black groundskeeper named Bungy Cummings, whom Cobb had known for years, attempted to shake Cobb's hand or pat him on the shoulder.''

In <bop>his<eop> 1665 book Micrographia, Robert Hooke describes the ``fantastical'' (structural, not pigment) colours of the Peacock's feathers:
True	Thus, diagnosis of the disease at an early stage leads to a favorable outcome not because of early treatment but because those patients tend to have a less-virulent form.

True	Sandeep Singh of Verdens Gang wrote that Journals is ``neither a profound diary or a studio album it could have been (...) But this is undoubtedly the best Bieber has bubbled up to now.'' The Washington Post's Alison Stewart offered a negative outlook on the project, writing that ``Justin Bieber ends a bad year with a bad album.'' In <bop>his<eop> review written for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <bop>Piet Levy<eop> wrote that Bieber is ``less an eager child than a confident adult, although when Bieber's flat come-ons are juxtaposed with seasoned R&B star R. Kelly on ''PYD,`` it's clear that as a performer, he still has a lot of growing up to do.''
False	According to the producer, Bieber suggested they to ``flip those Craig David chords and (...) create something.'' By doing so, he came up with the song ``Recovery'', a song that was finished at Cherry Beach Sound in Toronto. As <bop>he<eop> recalled, the process had <bop>Bieber<eop> hearing Boyd songs and selected them to sing, and many songs from the producer turned into songs off Journals.

Thirty-five years later he tracked down Rodr*guiez, and interviewed and photographed <bop>her<eop>.
False	Even when Johnson is offstage or the writing sags with exposition, the show, directed solidly by Bill Rauch, retains the vitalizing imprint of his performance.'' Other characters such as Hoover and George Wallace are ``merely sketched in,'' and the play ``sorely needs streamlining.'' In <bop>his<eop> review of the American Repertory Theater production, also starring <bop>Cranston<eop>, Isherwood said the play ``ultimately accrues minimal dramatic momentum.''
True	Faora was due to be given orders, but Clark Kent interrupted the proceedings before Faora and the rest of the soldiers were ordered by Zod to ``Kneel before Kal-El''.

False	In 1987, coming up with ideas for new shows, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner of Carsey-Werner Productions decided to look into the concept of the working mother as a central voice. Up until that point, there had been shows with working mothers, but only as an adjunct to the father in the family. Werner had suggested that they take a chance on <bop>Barr<eop> whom they had seen on The Tonight Show.

True	Murphy was elevated to the eight-man leadership group for the 2007 season.

However, an injury to prime midfielder Nick Stevens after Round 3 saw <bop>Murphy<eop> attract the opposition's best taggers in most games. While <bop>his<eop> form remained solid, shaking the experienced taggers proved too big a challenge for the second year player and he finished outside the top 10 in the club's best and fairest.
False	She was also more opened about Olivia's decision to reveal her plan to Ian after only knowing him for less than a day.

True	Unlike other Slayers, she has had no prophetic dreams of her destiny or of the Slayers before her, and is now trying to figure out what her destiny as the Slayer entails. Harth Fray -- Mel's twin brother, who was attacked by a vampire during a theft with Mel. To save <bop>his<eop> life, <bop>Harth<eop> deliberately drank the vampire's blood, thereby becoming a vampire himself.
True	To save his life, Harth deliberately drank the vampire's blood, thereby becoming a vampire himself. It is unprecedented for a Slayer to have a twin and, as an odd side-effect of this, Harth possesses the prophetic dreams and visions of past Slayers that Mel lacks. Erin Fray -- Mel's older sister. On opposing sides already because of <bop>her<eop> job as a cop and Melaka's thieving, <bop>Erin<eop> also blamed Mel for the death of their brother for a long time.
True	Widdemer's memoir Golden Years I Had recounts her friendships with eminent authors such as Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot, Thornton Wilder, and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

Peggy takes <bop>Marcy<eop> along with <bop>her<eop> to a bingo competition on the bad side of town.
False	In this back-door spin-off pilot (which features Bud, Steve Rhoades, and Marcy), two obnoxious college radio DJs, Mark and Oliver, are expelled by Steve Rhoades for suggesting that Rhoades got his dean job through blackmail, since he had been a chauffeur only two months before (in the episode ``Get the Dodge Outta Hell''). Marcy arrives at the radio station looking for April (guest star <bop>Keri Russell<eop>), a new bank employee who is romantically entangled with both Bud and a giant Russian basketball star named Nikolai. <bop>She<eop> decides to protest against Steve and get him fired.
True	Bud needs $700 for a trip to Milwaukee with the Fraternity, which Al refuses. To earn it, Bud takes up a job as a driving examiner. Due to Peggy's negligence, Al's driver's license has expired and he has to take the test again--with Jefferson's help. Bud takes <bop>Al<eop>'s test and gives <bop>him<eop> a hard time as a revenge for Al refusing to give him $700.

Vic Sotto said the decision to get <bop>Ritchie<eop> on the film was hard to make, considering that <bop>he<eop>, Tito Sotto, and Joey de Leon have bailed him out several times over the years on drug charges but did not change his ways.
False	It was here, then, that petitions were heard complaining of the conduct of William Hartwell, captain of Governor Berkeley's guard, in the suppression of the rebellion. Swann's Point was sold by the son of Col. Thomas Swann in 1706 to John Joseph Jackman, the plantation was purchased in turn from Jackman in 1709 by Major George Marable who three months later sold the plantation to his brother-in-law, John Hartwell.

True	Nicolai reviewed Otto R*ssler's research paper on the safety of the LHC and issued a statement highlighting logical inconsistencies and physical misunderstandings in R*ssler's arguments. Nicolai concluded that ``this text would not pass the referee process in a serious journal.'' Domenico Giulini also commented with Hermann Nicolai on <bop>Otto R*ssler<eop>'s thesis, concluding that ``<bop>his<eop> argument concerns only the General Theory of Relativity (GRT), and makes no logical connection to LHC physics; the argument is not valid; the argument is not self-consistent.''
False	Johnny ``Lam'' Jones (real name John Wesley Jones; born April 4, 1958 in Lawton, Oklahoma) is a former American sprinter and former American football player. He won a gold medal in the 4 x 100 meter relay at the 1976 Summer Olympics.

Receive, Sir, I beg, the assurance of the most distinguished respect with which I am, Your's etc. B.G. Cuvier ''-- Letter from the Perpetual Secretary to Mr Peter Nicholson. Although almost entirely forgotten as a mathematician, Nicholson is still remembered as an architect and in the 1978 edition of <bop>his<eop> standard work, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600--1840, Howard M. Colvin claims that ``<bop>Nicholson<eop> was one of the leading intellects behind nineteenth-century building technology. He used his great ability as a mathematician to simplify many old formulae used by architectural draughtsmen as well as to devise new ones.''
False	Shackelford also appeared as Gary Ewing on several episodes of CBS's Dallas ; this role had originally been played by actor David Ackroyd who was unable to return for future appearances.

False	She made a series of appearances in the British soap opera Emmerdale (then known by its original title Emmerdale Farm) coincidentally opposite Frazer Hines, one of the major stars of that show. In 1971 Padbury appeared in Piers Haggard 's cult British horror film Blood on Satan's Claw as the unfortunate <bop>Cathy Vespers<eop>. Coincidentally, <bop>she<eop> appeared alongside actor Anthony Ainley who a decade later would take the role of The Master in Doctor Who, including the above mentioned episode, The Five Doctors.
True	The PageTurner Awards were put on hold in 2008 to focus on Patterson's new initiative, ReadKiddoRead.com, which helps parents, teachers, and librarians find the best books for their children.

False	He is noted for his Grammy Award winning jazz orchestral recording titled The Black Dahlia. He is also a past head of A & R for Blue Note Records.

True	During her early and beginning years of writing, she had a natural inclination to write and to copy texts and use the vocabulary she learned in her own works. Cotterill mentions that from an early age, <bop>Elizabeth<eop> ``constantly read, copied down, studied, memorized, and repeated prayers, psalms, chapters of the Bible, excerpts from collections of biblical ``places,'' literary texts, and sermons.'' <bop>She<eop> resorted to writing as an outlet from her depression due to the deaths of her mother and sister and debates with her father over her marriage.

During the 2004--05 season Cardiff chairman Sam Hammam revealed that the club was in serious financial trouble and as such a number of players left the club to attempt to regain losses, including <bop>Kavanagh<eop> who signed for Wigan Athletic for a fee close to *400,000. Whilst at Wigan <bop>he<eop> started in the 2006 Football League Cup Final.
False	Saroja's mother Kanthamma (G. Varalakshmi) is cheated by Chalapati (Mikkilineni). Bhushaiah values sentimental about caste and clan and consequently does not accept Ravi's love for Saroja. So he leaves the house and marries Saroja in a temple. Ravi is posted as a <bop>Police Inspector<eop> in <bop>his<eop> own village only.
True	Simon Cowell accused Brown of being ``robotic and somewhat empty.'' In the end, Jackson and Abdul (who made the final judgment) sent Brown through to the Hollywood rounds. During the Hollywood rounds, Brown sang ``Reflection'' by Christina Aguilera, and was one of 24 semi-finalists of the fifth season of American Idol. Following <bop>her<eop> departure from Idol, <bop>Brown<eop> made hundreds of personal appearances in 2006, most covered by local or national media and drawing as many as 500 to 2,000 or more fans.

False	Jerome, and most of the Christian fathers, suppose that the reference is to Antiochus as the type of Antichrist, and that the description passes from the type to the antitype. Idolatry is presented as the chief sin in the Bible, and shiqquts is often used to describe such. In <bop>his<eop> campaign of Hellenization, Antiochus caused an altar to be erected on the altar for burnt-offerings of the Second Temple, on which pig sacrifices were offered to <bop>Zeus Olympios<eop>.

False	Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet. Nor was Gibbon alone in lavishing praise on Charles as the savior of Christendom and western civilization. H.G. Wells in <bop>his<eop> A Short History of the World said in Chapter XLV ``The Development of Latin Christendom'': ``The Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of <bop>Charles Martel<eop>, the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands.
True	She remarked that the storyline was an ``elaborate and relentless chase that takes those involved into primal psychological terrain.'' Stephen Holden writing in The New York Times applauded some of the realism displayed in the film, commenting, ``Nothing in the rest of the film comes close to matching the impact of <bop>Gideon<eop>'s carving the bullet from <bop>his<eop> arm with his hunting knife, then cauterizing the wound while emitting agonizing howls.

False	Burton, who was more interested in directing Ed Wood, later reflected he was taken aback by some of the focus group meetings for Batman Forever, a title which he hated. Producer Peter MacGregor-Scott represented the studio's aim in making a film for the MTV Generation with full merchandising appeal. Production went on fast track with Rene Russo cast as Dr. Chase Meridian but Michael Keaton decided not to reprise <bop>Batman<eop> because <bop>he<eop> did not like the new direction the film series was heading in.
True	The Boss came out clean and triumphant and made amends with his brother and owns a private island which he calls Nova Sicilia and his brother left the agency to pursue his dream of being a shipwright and vowed to never speak of their days in the prohibition again.

In <bop>his<eop> 2000 book Voodoo Science, <bop>Robert L. Park<eop> described Microwave News as ``an influential newsletter devoted entirely to the EMF-health issue'' (Page 141) but cited the American Physical Society, stating ``Paul Brodeur and Microwave News in particular, had given the public a seriously distorted view of the scientific facts.''

True	Since it was released on the 30th anniversary of Prince's Sign o' the Times, Spin's Andy Cush commented, ``it's clear that this is Styles's attempt to distinguish himself as an artist with real depth.

False	Additionally, while Davey's reputation as a receptacle of Cornish was well known in the area, none of his neighbours or descendants learned or recorded any of it. As such it is difficult to judge the accuracy of Matthews' claims or to gauge how much knowledge of the tongue Davey might actually have had. Davey is known to have had a copy of <bop>William Pryce<eop>'s 1790 Cornish work Archaeologia Cornu-Britannica, which <bop>he<eop> inherited from his father.
True	In his early years De Roos was inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement. An example of this can be found in his edition of Kunst en Maatschappij (Art and Society (1903)).

False	If surviving medieval folk rock bands shifted towards more mainstream progressive rock, progressive rock bands often included early music among their influences. Despite emerging from the British blues boom, the vocal style of Ian Anderson of <bop>Jethro Tull<eop> was often compared with a medieval troubadour, while the signature sound of <bop>his<eop> flute, later combined with the keyboard and stringed instrumental skills of the band, lent itself to a medieval element of the music.
True	The Young Conservatives of Texas gave him a cumulative score in 2013 of 74 percent.

The Texas Association of Business, however, awarded <bop>him<eop> a cumulative score of 87 percent.

True	But when Scorpius shows that he knows of Snape having been in love with Lily, Harry's mother - Snape's most closely guarded secret - Snape becomes convinced that he does indeed come from a different timeline where Harry and his friends won. Snape then reveals that he, together with the fugitive Ron and Hermione Granger, maintain the last remnants of Dumbledore's Army - still waging hopeless resistance against the all-powerful Voldemort. In talking with Scorpius, Snape had learned that <bop>Harry<eop> would name <bop>his<eop> son ``Albus Severus'' and would regard Snape as ``probably the bravest man I ever knew'' - and is deeply moved.
True	She also takes issue with Willis' trend to pick fights with ``straw men'', opining that these criticisms of his ``seem out of place in a book of such grand scope and reach.'' John E. Cort of Denison University, Ohio reviewed the book for the Religious Studies Review. Describing the ``densely argued'' book, Cort noted that in ignoring Jain and Buddhist iconography and temples, <bop>Willis<eop> had failed to encompass the same scope which <bop>he<eop> professes.

Ratan is relieved that his problem has been resolved and the family name is not tarnished.

When <bop>she<eop> tells Ratan, he asks her to keep this information a secret.
False	She competed at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin but she failed to match her early season form, finishing with a best clearance of 4.55*m.

Other songs examine the album's themes from different angles: ``Plea from a Cat Named Virtute'' is written from the perspective of a depressed person's cat, ``One Great City!'' is about Samson's love--hate relationship with <bop>his<eop> hometown of Winnipeg, and ``Our Retired Explorer'' imagines a dinner date between philosopher Michel Foucault and a hopelessly nostalgic member of <bop>Ernest Shackleton<eop>'s expedition to Antarctica.

True	Winthrop Sargeant, classical music critic at The New Yorker, compared the band's sound to the work of an ``impressionist composer with a great sense of aural poetry and a very fastidious feeling for tone color...

Astounding Science-Fiction reviewer P. Schuyler Miller reported that, once <bop>Finney<eop> sets out <bop>his<eop> premise, the novel becomes ``a straight chase yarn, with several nice gimmicks and a not entirely convincing denouement.''

True	The rise of pretenders was not related to war or famine as neither appeared consistently with the pretenders. If there tended to be any form of famine during a pretender's rise it was during their claim to power and not inspired by it. Catherine's illegitimate rise to power through the assassination of <bop>her<eop> husband, Peter III, did not inspire the pretenders since Elizabeth, who came to power in a similar fashion to <bop>Catherine<eop>, never had the same problem.
True	He married secondly, in 1776, Princess Sophie Dorothea of W*rttemberg and had issue, including the future Alexander I of Russia and Nicholas I of Russia. He succeeded as Emperor of Russia in 1796 and was murdered at Saint Michael's Castle in 1801.

False	John was probably still doux of Dyrrhachium in 1105/1106, when he is recorded by Anna Komnene to have been defeated in a campaign against the Dalmatia ns. As the threat of a renewed Norman invasion by Bohemond loomed, the Emperor replaced John with his younger brother Alexios. The name and identity of John's wife is unclear. <bop>He<eop> may be the nephew of <bop>Alexios I Komnenos<eop> named John who is recorded to have married an unnamed daughter of Michael VII Doukas (other candidates include John Taronites and Alexios' brother Adrianos Komnenos, who took the monastic name John).

Roland Huntford recorded in Shackleton of <bop>Hussey<eop>'s tendency to be ``determinedly cheery to the point of egregiousness''. The instrument, weighing twelve pounds, was rescued from the wreck of the Endurance as ``vital mental medicine'' by Shackleton, who made an exception of <bop>his<eop> ``2 lb per person'' instructions so that it could be saved.

True	The campaign was full of political mudslinging, with Lautenberg accusing Dawkins of being a carpetbagger, noting his very brief residency in the state, and also accusing Dawkins' campaign of lying about his war record.

Adolf Frederick never cared much for Tessin, but Louisa Ulrika had him appointed marshal at court and eventually royal governor of her son prince Gustav. Tessin was behind many amusements in the circle of the crown princess, and it was said that <bop>he<eop> was only too eager to please Louisa Ulrika in any way possible. There were unconfirmed rumors that Tessin was the lover of Louisa Ulrika during her tenure as crown princess. Her son <bop>Gustav III<eop> later addressed these rumors, that although Count Tessin had been in love with her, his feelings were one-sided and not answered by his mother, as a love affair with a noble contradicted the ``natural contempt'' which Louisa Ulrika herself as a royal felt for every subject, noble or not. Her circle at court included Henrika Juliana von Liewen, who immediately became her favorite among her ladies-in-waiting; the intellectual Cath*rine Charlotte De la Gardie, the scientist Eva Ekeblad, and the witty Anders Johan von H*pken.
True	The relation between Louisa Ulrika and Tessin was never well seen by Adolf Frederick. Contemporary witnesses state the Tessin was in love with her and ``was not always able to conceal his feelings for the crown princess''. It is unknown whether there was ever any physical relationship between the queen and Tessin, but Louisa Ulrika herself mention in her memoirs that she had been offended somehow in that aspect. According to Crown Prince Gustav wrote in 1769, that Tessin had made Louisa Ulrika ``suggestions far from the reverence one is expected to show toward a sovereign.'' <bop>The Queen<eop> felt <bop>her<eop> pride offended and informed the king, who surprised Tessin in his knees before the queen.

False	This trust is soon destroyed as Jack is charged for the murder of a suspect and is seen to show no remorse for his action. Jack is replaced by Constable Evan Jones to whom Tess takes an immediate interest but is also taken aback by his relentless foolhardiness.

False	Wendlinger recovered from his injuries, but when Sauber granted him an opportunity to drive in 1995 he was relieved of his duties before the Monaco event a year on from the accident, as his performances were disappointing. He was replaced by Jean-Christophe Boullion. Wendlinger came back briefly for Sauber in two Grands Prix at the end of the season, as <bop>Boullion<eop> also proved uncompetitive in relation to team-mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen. However, this return also proved to be a failure, and the 1995 Japanese and Australian Grands Prix proved to be <bop>his<eop> Formula One swansong.

False	In 2009, Ryan said, ``What's unique about what's happening today in government, in the world, in America, is that it's as if we're living in an Ayn Rand novel right now.

In April 2012, after receiving criticism from Georgetown University faculty members on <bop>his<eop> budget plan, Ryan rejected <bop>Rand<eop>'s philosophy as an atheistic one, saying it ``reduces human interactions down to mere contracts''.

False	Reviews of the film were positive for Hall and his co-stars, and one for People Weekly even claimed that Hall's performance `` pilfered the film'' from Ringwald. Despite achieving only moderate success at the box office, the film made overnight stars of Ringwald and Hall. Hall starred in two 1985 teen classics, both written and directed by <bop>John Hughes<eop>. <bop>He<eop> was cast as Brian Johnson, ``the brain,'' in the quintessential teen film The Breakfast Club, co-starring Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, and Ringwald.

True	Squeezit accomplishes this task, but has failed to include himself in the deal to rescue his friends, and the devil has him decapitated. Queen Doris sends Bust Rod to keep an eye on the king, and to ensure he doesn't find out where she's hidden Frenchy. Fausto catches Bust <bop>Rod<eop> and forces <bop>him<eop> to lead him to Frenchy and Ren*, whom he orders to leave the Sixth Dimension to avoid the Queen's wrath.

True	Curtis receives the unwelcome news from his Harley Street doctor that he has cancer. Later that day while watching television, Curtis sees acclaimed novelist Jonathan Stitch's acceptance speech for an award he gained at a prestigious book awards ceremony.

False	It is uncertain why he took this name, but he may have added it in honour of his native Silesia or to honor a favourite scholastic, mystic or theosophic author, to distinguish himself from other famous writers of his era: perhaps the Spanish mystic writer Juan de los *ngeles (author of The Triumph of Love) or Lutheran theologian Johann Angelus in Darmstadt. He no longer used the name Scheffler, but did on occasion use his first name, Johann. From 1653 until his death, he used the names Angelus Silesius and also Johann Angelus Silesius. Shortly after <bop>his<eop> conversion, on 24 March 1654, Silesius received an appointment as Imperial Court Physician to <bop>Ferdinand III<eop>, the Holy Roman Emperor.
False	Thomas Heathcote Sorby (16 February 1856 -- 13 December 1930) was an English amateur footballer who made one appearance for England. Sorby was born in Sheffield, the fourth of ten children of <bop>Thomas Austin<eop> Sorby (1823--1885) and Dorothy Heathcote (1826--1904). <bop>His<eop> father was a partner in Robert Sorby and Sons, the family business, described as ``Edge Tool Manufacturers''.
True	While civilian aircraft in other countries were frequently requisitioned for military purposes, Aer Lingus continued to fly a service between Dublin and Liverpool throughout the war. Winston Churchill, the British wartime Prime Minister, made an attack on the Irish Government and in particular *amon de Valera in his radio broadcast on VE Day. Churchill maintained that the British government displayed restraint on the Irish state while the de Valera government were allowed to ``frolic with the Germans''. Churchill maintained that the British could have invaded the Irish state but displayed ``considerable restraint'' in not doing so. De Valera replied to Churchill in a radio broadcast: Mr. <bop>Churchill<eop> makes it clear that in certain circumstances <bop>he<eop> would have violated our neutrality and that he would justify his action by Britain's necessity.
False	The community was centered on a blast furnace that was named for William Tecumseh Sherman. The Tecumseh Iron Company was organized in 1873 by Willard Warner, who was a brevet brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Warner served on <bop>General Sherman<eop>'s staff, so <bop>he<eop> named the furnace in his honor.
False	Susanna Rigacci is a Swedish-born Italian singer/soprano. Susanna Rigacci was born in 1960 in Stockholm, Sweden, the daughter of composer and conductor M.* Bruno Rigacci. She graduated in musical training at the Luigi Cherubini conservatory in Florence, and attended successfully a post graduate experience with Iris Adami Corradetti. Under <bop>her<eop> guidance, <bop>Susanna<eop> was awarded at the International ``Maria Callas'' Competition (Concorso RAI, 1983), and for the ``S*ngerf*rderungspreis'', at the Mozarteum (Salzburg, 1985).
True	However in 1900, he married Lillian ``Muddie'' O'Connell, also from Cork city. They had six children including five daughters Pearl (Binnie), Muriel, Cecil, Ita and Ethna, and a son Sarsfield. A contemporary and friend of Michael Collins, the Irish revolutionary, Smiddy was appointed by <bop>Collins<eop> to be <bop>his<eop> Economic Adviser to Plenipotentiaries for the Treaty Negotiations from October to December 1921 following the War of Independence.
True	Left for The Weather Channel in April 1987 Stan Verrett, now an anchor at ESPN and ESPNEWS, also worked for WVEC Kelly Wright, now at Fox News Channel <bop>Terry Zahn<eop>, joined as reporter and weekend anchor in 1981, became lead anchor in 1984, left in 1993 and joined WVEC in 1994, where <bop>he<eop> served as lead anchor until his death in 2000
True	The arrival of the statue is known to have coincided with Amenhotep III's marriage with Tadukhepa, Tushratta 's daughter, in the pharaoh's 36th year; letter EA 23's arrival in Egypt is dated to ``regnal year 36, the fourth month of winter, day 1'' of his reign. Furthermore, Tushratta never mentions in EA 23 that the statue's dispatch was meant to heal <bop>Amenhotep<eop> from <bop>his<eop> maladies.
False	After manager Mark Stimson left Stevenage to join Gillingham, Julian refused to sign a new contract, stating he wanted to ``keep his options open for the summer''. As a result, he was transfer-listed in January 2008. Despite being on the transfer-list, Julian remained first choice goalkeeper under new manager <bop>Peter Taylor<eop> until Stevenage's 3--1 home defeat to Torquay United on 12 April 2008, <bop>his<eop> final appearance of the season.
False	Face with rumours of a counter-attack by Napoleon, he organised the city's defences and then restored order in Paris, facing down the troubles provoked by the occupying troops by deploying mixed bodies of men consisting of both Russian and National Guard troops. On Louis XVIII's arrival on 20 April Rochechouart took leave of the Russian army to offer <bop>Louis<eop> <bop>his<eop> services.
False	On Louis XVIII's arrival on 20 April Rochechouart took leave of the Russian army to offer Louis his services. Louis-Victor-L*on de Rochechouart was made mar*chal de camp by <bop>Louis XVIII<eop>, incorporated into the company of black musketeers and on 29 August made a knight of the Ordre de Saint-Louis. <bop>He<eop> accompanied the king to Ghent during the Hundred Days and on their return on the Second Restoration he rose to chef d'*tat-major to the minister of war, to duc de Feltre, then mar*chal de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr, and then to the duc de Feltre when Rochechouart's adoptive father the duke of Richelieu was made prime minister.
False	Author Joel Kovel wrote that The Primal Scream shows that Janov is one of several figures in the history of psychotherapy who have come to be seen as savior figures, noting that the book had received ``extravagant praise'' from the Chattanooga Times and the Berkeley Gazette, both of which compared Janov to <bop>Freud<eop>. <bop>He<eop> credited Janov with tapping a ``bedrock of great emotional power.''
True	In an interview with The Guardian, Mohammed bin Hammam stated he might run against the incumbent president Sepp Blatter for the presidency of FIFA which will be decided during the 61st FIFA Congress between 31 May and 1 June 2011. He told the Guardian: ``People have to try change. Change is good.'' Bin Hammam said that <bop>Blatter<eop> was ``an experienced person, <bop>he<eop> has made significant contribution to football worldwide but I believe there is a time limit for everything.
False	The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers. Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to <bop>Richard Zanuck<eop>, that <bop>he<eop> was not making a ``documentary or realistic movie'' about her family, and that he would make the film with ``complete dramatic freedom'' in order to produce a ``fine and moving film''--one they could all be proud of.
True	Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's ``romantic nonsense and sentiment'', the children's ``artificial roles'', and Robert Wise's ``cosy-cum-corny'' direction. Judith Crist, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as ``icky sticky'' and designed for ``the five to seven set and their mommies''. In <bop>her<eop> review for McCall's magazine, <bop>Pauline Kael<eop> called the film ``the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat'', and that audiences have ``turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs''.
False	His grandson was Adam Walays who in turn had two sons, the eldest of whom succeeded to the family estates in Ayrshire. Adam's younger son was Malcolm Wallace who received the lands of Auchinbothie and Elderslie in Renfrewshire. Malcolm Wallace appears in the Ragman Rolls of 1296 paying allegiance to <bop>Edward I of England<eop>, however later <bop>he<eop> was one of the few Scottish nobles who refused to submit to Edward and as a result he and his son, Andrew, were executed.
False	Her third album Maba followed in 2004, and she is currently working on a new album. Nana is also a dancer, and famous for her heavily choreographed videos. In 2007, it was announced that Nana would be a judge on Idols West Africa, alongside Nigerian <bop>Dede Mabiaku<eop> and American Dan Foster; at twenty-seven, <bop>she<eop> was one of the youngest judges in Idols history.
True	In 1977, Hung was given his first lead role in a Golden Harvest production, in the film Shaolin Plot. His next film, released the same year, was also his directorial debut, The Iron-Fisted Monk, one of the earliest kung fu comedies. In 1978, Raymond Chow gave Hung the task of completing the fight co-ordination for the re-shoot of Game of Death, the film <bop>Bruce Lee<eop> was unable to complete before <bop>his<eop> death in 1973.
False	The report quotes Brian Naranjo of the University of California, Los Angeles to the effect that neutron energy spectrum reported in the 2006 paper by Taleyarkhan, et al. was statistically inconsistent with neutrons produced by the proposed fusion reaction and instead highly consistent with neutrons produced by the radioactive decay of Californium 252, an isotope commonly used as a laboratory neutron source . The response of Taleyarkhan et al., published in Physical Review Letters, attempts to refute Naranjo's hypothesis as to the cause of the neutrons detected. Tsoukalas, head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue, and several of <bop>his<eop> colleagues at Purdue, had convinced <bop>Taleyarkhan<eop> to move to Purdue and attempt a joint replication.
False	William M. Bugg, emeritus physics professor at the University of Tennessee also traveled to Taleyarkhan's lab to repeat the experiment with his equipment. He also reported neutron emission, using plastic neutron detectors. Taleyarkhan claimed these visits counted as independent replications by experts, but Forringer later recognized that he was not an expert, and Bugg later said that <bop>Taleyarkhan<eop> performed the experiments and <bop>he<eop> had only watched.
False	This information was instrumental in safety improvements within the manufacturing of aircraft engines, the development of military fighter canopies, and the creation of runway management plans. Laybourne's skills in forensic ornithology helped solve around 1,000 cases of bird-related airplane crashes a year. In addition to <bop>her<eop> employers, Laybourne's expertise aided the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, General Electric, the National Transportation Safety Board, Pratt and <bop>Whitney<eop>, and Rolls-Royce.
False	In that job, which involved him in the early electrical recording process, he met Jay Wilbur (James Edward Wilbur), a dance bandleader who interested him in the technical side of recording. The company folded, and Wilkinson took a job in charge of the recorded music at an ice rink in Brighton. Wilbur had joined Crystalate, another record company, and invited <bop>Wilkinson<eop> to join <bop>him<eop> at its studios in Hampstead.
False	The midnight dash went one and a half blocks to Annie's Paramount Steak House where the racers ran upstairs for a shot of schnapps, then down the stairs and back down the street to JR's. Clinton Winter won the race and a bottle of champagne. Dave Perruzza, general manager of <bop>JR<eop>.'s organized the event for its first 25 years. <bop>He<eop> organized hundreds of volunteers to help carry out the event and clean up afterward.
True	He can be heard on the Bill Handel Show on KFI AM 640 Radio, and XTRA Sports AM 570 in Los Angeles. He lives in Reno, Nevada, and does these shows via ISDN from a studio in Reno. With the departure of Paul T. Wall back to Guam, <bop>Rich<eop> has become increasingly verbal about <bop>his<eop> liberal political views and is a supporter of U.S. President Barack Obama.
True	Brent was born at Rotherhithe on 21 Aug. 1808, and was the eldest son of a father of the same name, a shipbuilder there, who about the year 1821 removed to Canterbury, and became thrice mayor of the city and deputy-lieutenant of the county. His mother was Susannah, third daughter of the Rev. Sampson Kingsford of Sturry, near Canterbury. In <bop>his<eop> early days <bop>Brent<eop> carried on the business of a miller, occupied for many years a seat on the council of the Canterbury corporation, and was elected an alderman, but resigned that position on being appointed city treasurer.
False	On February 13, 1933, Ecklund defeated Chick McBride in rounds two and three at the Bremerton Athletic Club and subsequently in Silverdale, Washington on February 23, 1933. Jack Kracken is best remembered as the first boxer defeated by <bop>Joe Louis<eop> on July 4, 1934 in the first round of a scheduled six-round bout at Bacon Casino on Chicago's South Side. Kracken was one of Chicago's top heavyweights at the time <bop>he<eop> fought Louis.
True	To add insult to injury, she reminds Josh about the job offer aloud to everyone, especially Clay. Even though Josh says he said no, the surrounding employees angrily ignore and shun him. Tracey reveals that she was given the same offer but explicitly rejected it where Josh kept it open. Feeling betrayed about what <bop>he<eop> heard from Carol, <bop>Clay<eop> rushes off with Savannah's emotionally unstable pimp Trina (Jillian Bell) to party elsewhere, though Trina is more interested in robbing Clay of his wealth that he is actually keeping on his person.
False	Clay ends up racing Trina's car towards an opening drawbridge, attempting to jump the gap, a feat he'd earlier mentioned to Josh. Josh drives Mary's minivan alongside him, and tries to convince Clay not to jump, but he is still angered and heartbroken from <bop>Carol<eop> offering Josh the job, as much as remembering <bop>her<eop> insults.
False	Mine Ha-Ha (2005) as Hidalla Spooks (2004) (TV series) guest starring as Jemma Roberts Rosemary & Thyme (2004, TV series) guest starring as Fern The Lost Prince (2003, TV) Invitation to the Waltz (2001, radio play) The Young Ambassadors (1998, radio play) Nighy was born in London, the daughter of actors Bill Nighy and <bop>Diana Quick<eop>. <bop>She<eop> was educated at the City of London School for Girls and Westminster School.
False	Their deaths- triggered by Sinclair's fear-inducing henchman Scarecrone causing them to remember the mugging, driving them to flee Chill by running off their balcony- prompt Bruce to become Batman to investigate, Gordon having written their deaths off as an accident and Bruce unwilling to investigate himself because of the risk to his new wife, Julie Madison. In the Flashpoint event, an alternate timeline is created where among other massive changes, Thomas Wayne rather than <bop>Bruce<eop> appears as Batman. Details after the events of <bop>his<eop> son's death remains ambiguous, but Thomas is shown to have Joe Chill's gun in the Batcave's trophy display, suggesting Thomas got his revenge.
False	It notes that, ``the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience, (reflects) the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation''. Writing in the Financial Times, Philip Stephens, one of the panellists, later accused the BBC's director-general, <bop>Mark Thompson<eop>, of misrepresenting the panel's conclusions. <bop>He<eop> further opined ``My sense is that BBC news reporting has also lost a once iron-clad commitment to objectivity and a necessary respect for the democratic process.
False	Kelly was found dead, by suicide, in a field close to his home early on 18 July. An inquiry led by Lord Hutton was announced by the British government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to Kelly's death, concluding that ``Dr. Kelly took his own life.'' In <bop>his<eop> report on 28 January 2004, Lord Hutton concluded that <bop>Gilligan<eop>'s original accusation was ``unfounded'' and the BBC's editorial and management processes were ``defective''.
True	While not the box office success of 20th Century Fox's Shirley Temple or Jane Withers, <bop>Virginia Weidler<eop> still has a loyal following to this day. In 2012, the Virginia Weidler Remembrance Society was created to honor <bop>her<eop> life and career.
False	Named ''Prince consort of French chanson`` by Camille Couteau in the newspaper Le Saule in January 2011 or compared to Berlioz by *ric Loret (''If Gainsbourg was Chopin``, Lib*ration, May 2010), Areski has also collaborated with <bop>Barbara<eop>, Georges Moustaki or Sapho. With <bop>her<eop>, he contributed to the Voix de la M*diterran*e festival in Lod*ve.
True	Frank Marino (born 1965 in Brooklyn, New York) is a female impersonator dubbed Ms. Las Vegas for his longtime starring role as Joan Rivers in the Las Vegas drag revue Frank Marino's Divas Las Vegas, playing at the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Famous for <bop>his<eop> lavish on-stage wardrobe (much of which was designed by Bob Mackie, who has also done fashions for Rivers), <bop>Marino<eop> has received two Las Vegas Walk of Fame stars and received another star as well as having a street named after him when Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman honored his hard work and commitment to the Las Vegas performance world with ``Frank Marino Day'' on February 1, 2005.
False	They play a pair of criminals on parole and working in a department store full of similar cases; Harry Carey's character routinely hires ex-convicts to staff his store. The movie was written by Norman Krasna and Virginia Van Upp. Mr Morris runs a department store which specialises in hiring former inmates who want to assimilate into civilian life. Two of <bop>his<eop> employees, <bop>Joe<eop> and Helen, have fallen in love.
False	These villages and parishes sent men to fight in the Great War, 1914-1918, and all of them came back alive. In 1696 the non-conformist cleric and hymn-writer Isaac Watts (1674--1748) was appointed minister to the <bop>Hartopp<eop> family of Stoke Newington and Freeby. <bop>He<eop> preached at the Congregational chapel in the village until 1699.
False	He felt that using the characters of List and Hill to tie the series into Age of Ultron was ``the right way'' to tie the two together, and was also positive of the character beats for Simmons and Palamas. Goldman also made special mention of <bop>Tancharoen<eop>'s direction of the one-shot fight, though <bop>he<eop> felt that Tancharoen's May vs.
True	Michael manages to make Harry see sense, but throws his gun into the river before he can cause any further damage. Inspector Yilmaz warns Harry to stay away from Fazouk and let the police continue with their investigation. Back in England, Joanna receives a postcard, seemingly from <bop>Olivia<eop>, stating that <bop>she<eop> is safe and well but need to get away for a while.
False	Meanwhile, Harry's son Michael (Gary Lucy) flies out to Istanbul to help with the search. Harry, deciding that Fazouk knows more than he is letting on, threatens him at gunpoint in front of a club full of paying customers. Michael manages to make <bop>Harry<eop> see sense, but throws <bop>his<eop> gun into the river before he can cause any further damage.
False	As unrest starts to unfold across the country, Harry and Joanna meet with a Kurdish woman who claims that Olivia gave her passport and plane ticket to her daughter as an act of kindness, to allow her to come to Britain to be with her husband and young daughter. Harry and Joanna begin to realise that Olivia's disappearance may not be as sinister as they first thought. But when a call finally comes in with a lead on <bop>her<eop> whereabouts, are Harry and <bop>Joanna<eop> set to be re-united with their daughter, or has tragedy struck?
False	He closed out his career with 3,553 yards rushing and still ranks third on OSU's all-time rushing list, trailing only Heisman Trophy winners Archie Griffin (5,589) and Eddie George (3,768). Spencer shared time with <bop>Kevin Long<eop> as the starting running back with Chicago and rushed for 1157 yards on 300 carries with 6 touchdowns in <bop>his<eop> rookie season.
True	Dur*n tells his wife that he regrets letting them down and needs to go back in the ring in order to regain his popularity and the forgiveness of his fans. Due to this incident, Arcel is retired from his training and tells Dur*n that Plomo will be his coach. In June 1983, New York City, the day of <bop>his<eop> fight against Davey Moore, <bop>Leonard<eop> gratefully meets Dur*n for the first time since the rematch, saying that he forgives Dur*n.
True	Forever Changes, released in November 1967 and recorded and co-produced by Bruce Botnick is a suite of songs using acoustic guitars, strings, and horns that was recorded while the band was falling apart as the result of various substance abuse problems and tension between Arthur Lee and <bop>Bryan MacLean<eop>, who wanted more of <bop>his<eop> songs on the album.
False	Claude Rivi*re states that Fourneau is the opposite of being a fashionable painter: ``A great admirer of Antonin Artaud, of Paulhan, of Aragon, the artist calls upon his understanding of his model and goes beyond just a formal expression to impose his point of view.'' Jean Paulhan asks himself: ``By what secret, Jean-Claude Fourneau possesses such prolific fierceness?'' . Jean-Claude Fourneau appears on a photograph of surrealist artists gathered at the Caf* Cyrano in 1953, and <bop>Andr* Breton<eop> mentions <bop>him<eop> as being part of the group.
True	On the national level, Martin was a member of the American Philatelic Society (APS) and served it in various ways, including acting as a member of the Board of Vice Presidents from 1939 to 1943. Martin was also the Cleveland representative for the National Federation of Stamp Clubs which had been founded by Harry L. Lindquist. For <bop>his<eop> dedication to the advancement of stamp collecting in the Cleveland area, <bop>Martin<eop> was awarded the Hanford and Herman trophies by the Garfield-Perry Stamp Club.
True	Although Curtis's involvement in the project was short-lived, Roundabout would eventually evolve into Deep Purple the following year. Chris Curtis choice of Bobby Darin's ``When I Come Home'' despite a strong band performance, was a relative chart failure by their standards, which to an extent undermined <bop>his<eop> position as song selector for the band thereafter, and some internal disagreements over musical policy/direction, that had been evident earlier when Tony Jackson left resurfaced, which probably further hindered the group's musical progression and very likely played a part in <bop>Curtis<eop> leaving in 1966.
True	With this and other subtle changes, such as using lactose in place of glucose, they were able to push up yields of penicillin to 20 units per ml. But their cooperation had become one-sided. Heatley noted that ``Moyer had begun not telling me what he was doing.'' Florey returned to Oxford that September, but <bop>Heatley<eop> stayed on in Peoria until December, then for the next six months <bop>he<eop> worked at Merck & Co. Inc. in Rahway, New Jersey.
False	Inescort's acting debut came in The Truth About Blayds (1922), which was presented at the Booth Theatre on Broadway. <bop>Her<eop> other Broadway credits include You and I (1923), The Woman on the Jury (1923), Windows (1923), The Fake (1924), <bop>Ariadne<eop> (1925), Hay Fever (1925), Love in a Mist (1926), Mozart (1926), Trelawny of the ``Wells'' (1927), Escape (1927-1928), Napi (1931), Company's Coming (1931), Springtime for Henry (1931-1932), When Ladies Meet (1933), False Dreams, Farewell (1934), Lady Jane (1934), Soldier's Wife (1944-1945), The Mermaids Singing (1945-1946), and You Never Can Tell (1948).

He spent the years of World War II in court-martial proceedings after attempting to enlist in the United States Army. His book talks about how he felt personally singled out by General John L. DeWitt An Italian-American, <bop>Remo Bosia<eop> was born in Madera, California, and moved to Europe at age six with <bop>his<eop> parents.
True	The sisters decided to drown Linda because they believed it would be ``fast and unspectacular''. After formulating a murder plan, Sandra and Beth informed three of their friends, who all encouraged the sisters and laughed at the idea of murdering <bop>Linda<eop>. During lunch time on January 18, 2003, the sisters began giving their mother liquor in order to get <bop>her<eop> drunk.
True	Growing up in Indonesia, Wendy was ridiculed for not being fluent in Bahasa Indonesia; her Muslim faith and failure to speak English fluently would also make her a subject of ridicule among her peers in the Philippines. A modern Filipina with a strong devotion to Islam, <bop>Tabusalla<eop> has earned a living from joining beauty pageants and working as a model. <bop>She<eop> was evicted on Day 99.
False	To support his sister's dream of attending college, he entered several jobs including fishing, farming and being a make-up artist in a mortuary. He was named the third Big Placer on Day 155. Seiichi ``Seichang'' Ushimi (born March 16, 1989) is a 22-year-old Japanese-Filipino from Tokyo, Japan. Born and raised by <bop>his<eop> grandmother in Japan, Seichang only knows how to speak English and <bop>Japanese<eop>.
True	The ship's carpenter tried to build an improvised rudder to try to steady the ship's course, but in the rough seas it provided no relief. In spite of his crew's pleas to transfer to Hector, <bop>Lancaster<eop> insisted that the crew remain on Red Dragon, telling <bop>his<eop> crew that they would ``yet abide Gods leisure.''
False	In October 2006, Cooper returned to Scottish football with Second Division Peterhead, as he took on the role of first team coach under the management of Steve Paterson. When Paterson left Peterhead in early 2008, <bop>Cooper<eop> took over as manager. Peterhead narrowly missed out on the end of season playoffs for a place in the Scottish First Division in 2008 finishing 5th, however <bop>he<eop> guided the Blue Toon to 4th the following season and a playoff against 2nd bottom Airdrie United from Division One.
False	He was requested to investigate and report upon the system of instruction at the military schools of England, France, Germany, and Austria, and to attend and report upon the maneuvers of the 17th Corps of the French army in 1884. Lieut. Wisser was aide-de-camp to Gen. <bop>John Gibbon<eop> during the Chinese troubles in Washington territory in 1886, but in August of that year <bop>he<eop> returned to the U. S. Military Academy.
True	Guadalcanal Diary was shot from May 14 to late July, 1943, mostly on location at Camp Pendleton, near Oceanside, California.

The picture marked the screen debuts of stage actor Robert Rose and <bop>Richard Jaeckel<eop>, who was a studio messenger boy when <bop>he<eop> was cast in the production.
False	Nasharudin survived with the backing of the conservative ulama faction; his two opponents had split the moderate vote. But at the 2011 assembly, Nasharudin was not so lucky: Mohamad Sabu, a leading moderate close to Anwar Ibrahim, commanded the support of the ``<bop>Erdogan<eop>'' wing and toppled <bop>him<eop>.
True	The former bears her child on 3 July, whereas neither of Elisabeth's children was born on that day. Indeed, Margot and Egmont von Ardenne were given birth on 5 November and 4 January respectively. Finally, Elisabeth von Ardenne's day of birth is 26 October, while <bop>Effi Briest<eop> is said to celebrate <bop>her<eop> birthday sometime in August.
False	The story tells how, with marvelous pluck, Tom meets all the contemptible means which her enemies employ in order to down her, they resorting even to the law, blackmail, arson, and attempted murder. In all her mannish employments her mother-heart beats warm and true, and her little crippled Patsy, a companion to Dickens's Tiny Tim, and <bop>Jenny<eop> the daughter with <bop>her<eop> own tender love affair, are objects of Tom's constant solicitude.
False	She has performed on every stage in New Orleans as a mistress of ceremonies, songstress, lead in musical theatre, and dramatic actress. Mintz is best known for her portrayal of Amanda Wingfield in a production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie, and <bop>Desiree<eop> in Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler's A Little Night Music. <bop>She<eop> wrote and produced Dark Secrets, about the life and career of Russian composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky as well as a series of poetry shows.

She has performed on every stage in New Orleans as a mistress of ceremonies, songstress, lead in musical theatre, and dramatic actress. Mintz is best known for <bop>her<eop> portrayal of Amanda Wingfield in a production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie, and <bop>Desiree<eop> in Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler's A Little Night Music.
True	The Bears had Jay Cutler, Caleb Hanie, and Dan LeFevour already on the roster. During the offseason, Chicago also picked up Todd Collins and Matt Gutierrez. Williams has not received any other invitations from professional teams. On October 4, 2010 after a game against the New York Giants in which both starting QB Jay Cutler and 2nd stringer Todd Collins were knocked out of the game, <bop>Williams<eop> tweeted that the Bears had contacted <bop>him<eop> and that he was ``high on their list.''
False	Newport Gwent Dragons captain Lee Byrne was forced to retire in April 2015 after he failed to recover from a shoulder injury. It was announced in July 2015 that Welsh international T. Rhys Thomas would captain the side for the 2015--16 season. Ospreys captain Alun Wyn Jones missed the start of the season while playing for Wales at the World Cup. In <bop>his<eop> absence, the side was captained by <bop>Lloyd Ashley<eop>.
True	There, he fights his way through Blanco's men until he gets picked up by Abacus's contact, who takes him to Blanco's mansion. Blanco and his surviving allies fight Miller in a pitched battle in the back, dying one by one until only <bop>Blanco<eop> stands. Wounded, <bop>he<eop> tries to escape, but is immediately gunned down by Wild Dog, who survived his apparent death but lost his left arm, which he replaced with a gatling gun.
False	He then discovers Serrano is alive and well, having been kept by Dog as a bargaining chip after his death was faked. The president reveals Dog and Kantaris are conspiring to mine his country's rich titanium resources so that they can build mechanized battlesuits, under the name ``Project Titan''. Serrano gives <bop>Miller<eop> the project blueprints before making <bop>his<eop> escape.
False	He was first elected to Parliament in the 1975 elections as MP for Otago, defeating the newly elected Ian Quigley of the Labour Party. In 1978, he was appointed to his first ministerial roles, most notably Minister of Tourism. When Brian Talboys retired from Parliament in 1981, <bop>Cooper<eop> was appointed to replace <bop>him<eop> as Minister of Foreign Affairs -- he held this position until the government of Robert Muldoon was defeated in 1984.
False	release is the fact that NIS America has actually provided an English dub with the series, their first ever. That being said, they sure have done an amazing job with the English voice cast. Finding a voice actress that can match Rie Kugimiya's tsundere voice work is a hard task to accomplish but <bop>Cassandra Lee Morris<eop> has done an excellent job filling <bop>her<eop> shoes by replicating the character perfectly in English.
True	He can be considered a kenshi, a swordsman who is not from the samurai class. He despises the government by extension to his hatred of samurai and quits the Itto-ryu when Anotsu allies the group with Kagimura and the shogunate, though he remains on friendly terms with Anotsu. When <bop>his<eop> lover of sorts, a prostitute named O-Ren, iss killed by Shira, <bop>Magatsu<eop> ends up following Manji around due to the fact that he knows Shira is after Manji.
False	Karen Strassman (English) played by <bop>Chiaki Kuriyama<eop> A female assassin and a lieutenant in the Mugai-ry*. Hyakurin was the wife of an abusive samurai, Hayakawa Kak*sai Genkei, who was obsessed with trying to gain fame by training Matsuhiko, their sickly son, to become a strong swordsman, and killed Matsuhiko's unnamed twin sister shortly after <bop>her<eop> birth because he saw no worth in raising a girl.
True	Hazard is divorced and hasn't seen his son in years due to the bitter divorce. After Willow's father, who is a retired U.S. Army master sergeant and a former Korean War comrade in arms of Hazard's and Nelson's, dies of a heart attack, <bop>Hazard<eop> comes to look upon Willow as a ``son.'' <bop>He<eop> tries to teach Willow all he can about soldiering and surviving in combat.
False	Wildman is later ordered to Vietnam, where he distinguishes himself as a heroic soldier and effective combat infantryman. He returns from Vietnam promoted to the rank of sergeant and is a recipient of the Medal of Honor for heroism in combat. Sergeant Flanagan (<bop>Larry Fishburne<eop>), a fellow member of Hazard's platoon, receives <bop>his<eop> orders for Vietnam at the same time.
False	Leila won and received a House of Marley package worth over $3,000 and a spa treatment courtesy of Half Moon resort. For the photo shoot, photographed by Tyra Banks, the contestants portrayed warriors at Dunn's River Falls. Leila received the highest score of the week, while <bop>Kiara<eop>'s photo was chosen by Banks to hang in <bop>her<eop> house.
False	Goethe encouraged Schopenhauer to write On Vision and Colors. Schopenhauer wrote it in a few weeks while living in Dresden in 1815. After it was published, in July 1815, Goethe rejected several of <bop>Schopenhauer<eop>'s conclusions, especially as to whether white is a mixture of colors. <bop>He<eop> was also disappointed that Schopenhauer considered the whole topic of color to be a minor issue.
False	Woodsmall was born in Atlanta, Georgia on September 20, 1883, the youngest of three children of Harrison S. Woodsmall, a lawyer and teacher, and <bop>Mary Elizabeth Howes<eop>, an art teacher. <bop>She<eop> grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana and attended local schools.
False	The name came from the comic strip Sazae-san, and his resemblance to the character Katsuo Isono. He joined Tozawa-juku in 2006, assuming the role of their drum bearer. He reverted to his real name with the Tozawa-juku faction, but he continued to wrestle in Dragon Gate NEX as Katsuo. Like <bop>his<eop> stablemate <bop>Akira Tozawa<eop>, he became known as a troublemaker backstage, and didn't seem to catch on with fans.
True	Jo*o de Barros wrote in 1553 in his 2nd D*cadas da *sia (``Decades of Asia''), a history of the Portuguese in India and Asia that Parameswara (Paramicura) who were driven away from Temasik after he killed the representative of the King of Siam, Temagi, had escaped in exile and stopped in Muar and built in rural areas of Muar called Pagoh. Tun Sri Lanang: Shellabear version: In the Sejarah Melayu or Malay Annals states that Temasik during the reign of Parameswara (<bop>Sultan Iskandar Shah<eop>) was defeated by Majapahit Kingdom. But <bop>he<eop> and his family including his followers had fled to Pagoh, Muar and opened two areas on the banks of the Muar River; Biawak Busuk and build a fort called Kota Buruk before moved to and opened up Melaka.
False	As Danner is set to adopt one of the children, a child named John asks him if Danner will go take him ``make poop,'' which startles Danner quite a bit, especially the prospect of having to watch him. Afterwards, Father Joe comes up to the dorm room where Hank has run off too, telling him to pack his bags. First thinking <bop>he<eop>'s being kicked out, Hank grows very apologetic for the first time, until <bop>Father Joe<eop> explains himself:
False	Coal was first reported in Brunei Darussalam near Muara as early as 1837. in Serai Pimping. The Muara coalmine was first mined commercially in 1883, when William Cowie was given the concession rights to mine the coal in exchange for $1,200 per year. However, Cowie later sold <bop>his<eop> rights to Rajah Charles Brooke and the <bop>Rajah<eop> renamed the mine Brooketon (Brooke Town).
False	While Jay and Will argue about whether or not Jay had lied about his success with girls and the nature of the caravan club in general (Jay believes he is excused, as Neil had by chance been successful with one girl) Simon confronts a confused <bop>Neil<eop> regarding the state of <bop>his<eop> car following the sexual acts in which Neil was involved.
False	In response, the prosecutor simply plays a video that the three teenagers made of them breaking into a morgue and having sex with a severed head. Afterwards, Jimmy complains about being paid too little for the defense. He gets a call from a prospective client, to whom he pretends to be his own mild-mannered Irish secretary. On <bop>his<eop> way out of the parking lot, Jimmy is stopped by <bop>Mike Ehrmantraut<eop>, the parking lot attendant, who refuses to let him exit without either a payment or a court-supplied parking sticker.
True	Raja Krishnachandra of Nadia, a landlord under Nawab Sirajuddaula of Bengal, heard Ramprasad's hymns. Being an ardent devotee of Kali, he appointed Ramprasad as his court poet. Ramprasad rarely attended the Maharaja's court and would spend his time in sadhana and worship of Kali instead. Krishna Chandra became <bop>Ramprasad<eop>'s benefactor, giving <bop>him<eop> 100 acres (0.40 km*; 0.16 sq mi) of tax free land.
False	Scholar Shuma Chakrovarty notes that his songs are ``broadcast over the radio and sung on the streets and in the homes and temples of Calcutta by a cross-section of people--children, the elderly, housewives, businessmen, scholars, the illiterate, monks, householders, and the youth of all classes''. Many of <bop>his<eop> songs were sung by popular Shyama Sangeet singers like Dhananjay Bhattacharya, Pannalal Bhattacharya, and <bop>Anup Ghosal<eop>.
False	Wood served on several committees in the Iowa Senate - the Appropriations committee; the Education committee; the Human Resources committee; the Natural Resources and Environment committee; and the State Government committee. He was chair of the Education Appropriations Subcommittee. Wood was elected in 2004 with 15,500 votes (51%), defeating Republican opponent <bop>Bryan J. Sievers<eop>. <bop>He<eop> was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in the Iowa Senate elections, 2008.
False	He worries about their future together, but Portia reassures him by saying that everyone, even Nick and Brother Jeremiah, will change their minds about their relationship when they hear Nigel's beautiful sonnets (``We See the Light''). Nigel is not very happy with ``Omelette'' and claims that it doesn't feel right. Brother Jeremiah interrupts the lovers and takes Portia away to be imprisoned in a tower for disobeying. Saddened by the loss of <bop>his<eop> love, Nigel becomes inspired to write a completely different play that is revealed to be <bop>Hamlet<eop>.
False	He comes back from US to find out what happened 2 years back. Aditi Sajwan portrays Nitya Mitra, the best friend and lover of Dev, Payal's Elder Sister. (Before facial plastic surgery) Kishwar Merchant portrays Raima Maheshwari, the best friend of <bop>Sakshi<eop> who has an extramarital relationship with <bop>her<eop> husband, Rajnath.
True	The MacKillop buildings have produced rental income for the college. Sister Anne Marie Power R.S.J. has said that <bop>Mary MacKillop<eop> (St Mary of the Cross) ``would have a smile of approval for this important educational venture which is doing so much for the Catholic youth of Rotorua - a place very dear to <bop>her<eop> heart for the care that was afforded her there in a time of failing health, and especially because it was she herself who initiated the founding of the first Catholic school in Rotorua.''
False	However, it does explain the reason why today's saint is often honored as a bishop. The monastery at Icanho (in East Anglia, but the exact site is disputed) was destroyed in Danish raids. It is said that when by the orders of Saint Aethelwold Botolph's body was disinterred for translation to the new abbey of Thorney, Adulf's body was buried with it, and as it proved impossible to disentangle the bones, both were taken to Thorney, where the relics of Adulf remained. <bop>His<eop> feast day is 17 June, along with <bop>Botolph<eop>.
False	In 1767 she married John Damer, the son of Lord Milton, later the 1st Earl of Dorchester. The couple received an income of *5,000 from Lord Milton, and were left large fortunes by Milton and <bop>Henry Conway<eop>. They separated after seven years, and <bop>he<eop> committed suicide in 1776, leaving considerable debts.
True	A man named Talbot tells Captain Ockham that this is not acceptable. Talbot begins to question Sam about his interest in the Sunda Trench, but Sam tells him he's just looking to get away on a trip. Ockham asks why Talbot is questioning Sam, and <bop>Talbot<eop> responds that <bop>his<eop> employers know a great deal about Ockham and his crew and that they have too much at stake to risk any surprises.
True	His partner, Sonya was a flight attendant on Flight 815. Sonya was a flight attendant on Flight 815 and Sam's girlfriend. Oscar Talbot is a mysterious man who runs the Christiane I expedition. David Massingham and Tracey R are friends of <bop>Sam Thomas<eop> that gather information for <bop>him<eop>.
False	Harvey Weinstein, whose Miramax Films funded the film, said, ``It was the longest standing ovation I've seen in over 25 years''. On May 22, 2004, the film was awarded the Palme d'Or. It was the first documentary to win that award since Jacques Cousteau's and <bop>Louis Malle<eop>'s The Silent World in 1956. Just as <bop>his<eop> much publicized Oscar acceptance speech, Moore's speech in Cannes included some political statements:
False	His form was rewarded when he was voted on to the League of Ireland Premier Division Team for 2008, receiving 59% of the votes for the centre back position. After rejecting a new deal with the club, Burns reunited with former boss Sean Connor at Dundalk for the 2009 season. Prior to the start of the 2010 season, Burns had been training with Shamrock Rovers with the aim of joining them, but after the signing of <bop>Dan Murray<eop> Burns was not going to be offered a contract, so <bop>he<eop> re-signed for Dundalk and was named captain.
False	In fact, she arguably became the most popular Angel and had the most episodes centered on her. Petite and owning lots of ``va-voom'' , her blond e hair and proclivity toward bikini s didn't hurt, either. As her sister did before <bop>her<eop>, Kris tended to take the ``inside'' covers with Kelly while working on the case, while <bop>Sabrina<eop> took ``outside'' roles.
False	Fans have credited him for being very down-to-earth. In 1997, as the young Hammer and Way Deep started their music production career, a friend (Edward Adu Mensah) introduced them to Obrafour, a potential rapper with unusual singing abilities and after vigorous grooming from Hammer, <bop>his<eop> debut album produced by Hammer and Way Deep was released on the Home Base Record label owned by <bop>Daniel ``Masoul'' Adjei<eop> and was later managed by Noise Management, owned by Abraham Ohene Djan in August 1999.
True	He became the eleventh player to reach 1500 points, doing so on October 25, 2006, with an assist against the Washington Capitals, and the sixth to do so with one franchise. Gordie Howe, Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Raymond Bourque and Steve Yzerman are the others who have achieved this feat. On March 22, 2008, <bop>Sakic<eop> notched <bop>his<eop> 1,000th career assist against the Edmonton Oilers on a second period goal scored by Tyler Arnason.
False	The mulloway served at the restaurant is sourced from an aquafarm in Palmers Island, New South Wales. Simon Thomsen visited the restaurant in 2009 for the Sydney Morning Herald, writing that ``Quay could easily trade on its good looks - those harbour, Opera House and bridge views - but <bop>Gilmore<eop> is creating food as sublime and spectacular as the setting.'' <bop>He<eop> went on to describe Gilmore's cooking as a ``virtuoso'' performance.
True	Issei Futamata Rika Nozawa (** ** Nozawa Rika) One of Tarao's friends. Voiced by: Reiko Katsura Takeo (*** Takeo) One of Tarao's friends. Voiced by: Reiko Yamada Hiroshi Nakajima (** * Nakajima Hiroshi) <bop>Katsuo<eop>'s best friend and <bop>his<eop> classmate.
True	After the fall of Martinique, the rest of the French West Indies, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent, fell to the British without a fight. On May 6, 1762, in reward for his actions in Martinique, Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell promoted <bop>Montgomery<eop> to captain and gave <bop>him<eop> command of one of the ten companies of the 17th Foot.
True	In 1685 he was elected bishop of Macerata and Tolentino, April 9, 1685, and later was appointed Nuncio in Cologne in 1696. Pope Innocent XII elevated him to the rank of cardinal in the consistory of 19 December 1698, and he became archbishop of Ferrara. <bop>He<eop> became Cardinal Secretary of State during the pontificate of Pope Clement XI. On Clement's death, at the succeeding conclave of 1721, <bop>Paolucci<eop> was the strongest candidate to succeed, but was vetoed by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor as he considered him too close to the French.
False	Marshall is portrayed by Chadwick Boseman in a movie, Marshall, which revolves around the 1941 case of the State of Connecticut v. Joseph Spell. The movie was released October 2017. Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien ``Buster'' Burey in 1929. After <bop>her<eop> death in February 1955, Marshall married <bop>Cecilia Suyat<eop> in December of that year.
True	Destined for the church at a very young age, Albert was made canon of Magdeburg Cathedral in 1392. Five years later, in 1396, the brothers Sigismund and Albert decided to settle on a formal division of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst. As ``Lord of K*then,'' <bop>Albert<eop> took possession of the town of K*then as <bop>his<eop> main residence and capital of his newly-created principality.
False	The most prominent among them was Melchior van Santvoort, who had married a Japanese women and with whom he begot a daughter. Not long after arriving in Dejima, Verstegen asked Santvoort's daughter to marry him. In 1635, he was appointed to the position of trader. On December 7 of that year, Verstegen wrote to Governor <bop>Antonie van Diemen<eop> that <bop>he<eop> had learned of some Japan's islands (at around the 37th parallel north) where almost everything was made of gold and silver.
True	She told that if she was elected, the country would ``head towards a common future'', including those that had been displaced from the south and had come from the Turkish mainland after 1974, and that ``the outdated mentality would become history''. Prime Minister *zkan Yorganc*o*lu, former president Mehmet Ali Talat and former prime minister Ferdi Sabit Soyer also spoke in the rally, and Talat claimed that they would win the election in the first round. During <bop>his<eop> campaign, <bop>*zersay<eop> promised that if elected president, he would not only follow an active diplomatic policy in the negotiations, but also combat the ``rife partisanship and nepotism'' in politics, which he claimed was a role neglected using the peace process as a pretext.
False	Willie Ryan, who was named team captain at the start of the season, had to make do with a place on the substitutes bench. Goalkeeper Brendan Cummins, full-forward Eoin Kelly and right-corner forward Lar Corbett were the only survivors from the last Tipperary team to play in an All-Ireland final in 2001. Kilkenny manager Brian Cody in naming <bop>his<eop> team, omitted 2008 All-Ireland-winning captain James ``Cha'' Fitzpatrick for the final in favour of <bop>Derek Lyng<eop>.
True	Printz established the Belles Celebrity Answering Service in 1956, the same year the Broadway play opened, getting up at 4 a.m. in order to be able to arrive at the switchboard to make wake up calls that started as early as 5 a.m. There, Printz provided her customers with services that went beyond messages. Starting with Hermione Gingold, who was on the calling end of <bop>Printz<eop>'s first message, <bop>her<eop> clients included Candice Bergen, Shirley MacLaine, Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, Brooke Shields, Liz Smith, Spencer Tracy, Kathleen Turner, Tennessee Williams, as well as members of the band Kiss.
True	In addition to the title track, she had two more hit singles, ``Honey For The Bees'' (#24 R&B and #6 Dance) and ``The Heat of Heat''. Produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, noted for their later work with Janet Jackson, the latter track returned <bop>Austin<eop> to the top 15 of the R&B charts for what would be the last time to date. It would also be <bop>her<eop> last Hot 100 charting to date, although she would score a top-5 dance hit with the single Reach that appeared originally on her 1994 CD That Secret Place.
False	With their leadership gone, the two Camorra gangs disappeared and D'Aquila and the Schiro family in Brooklyn took over many of their rackets in Brooklyn. Soon after, D'Aquila absorbed the Mineo gang, making Mineo his first lieutenant. D'Aquila now controlled the largest and most influential Italian gang in New York City. It was about this time that Joe Masseria, another former <bop>Morello<eop> captain, began asserting <bop>his<eop> influence over the Lower East Side's Little Italy and began to come into conflict with D'Aquila's operations there, as Prohibition approached.
False	Second World War ace, Wing Commander John Baldwin, Squadron Leader Harbison, and two junior officers were selected for this task. Harbison's specific assignment was with the USAF 4th Fighter Group to evaluate combat tactics used by the F-86 against the Soviet MiG-15. On 13 February 1952, Harbison reported to Colonel <bop>Harrison Thyng<eop>, commander of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Kimpo Air Base, South Korea where <bop>he<eop> was assigned to the 335th Fighter Squadron.
False	Since 1992, Allen has worked regularly, primarily in guest or recurring roles on various television series. These include Doogie Howser, M.D. and Silk Stalkings. Allen also had a recurring role in the T.V. series Bull playing the character Pam Boyd. Allen won the recurring role of <bop>Amy Madison<eop> on Buffy the Vampire Slayer for the season one episode ``Witch''. <bop>She<eop> returned as Amy in the second season's ``Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered'', the season three episode ``Gingerbread'' (where her character was turned into a rat) and season four's ``Something Blue'' (in a brief, non-speaking cameo).
True	An important political figure, Giuseppe Spataro, was born in Vasto, on 12 June 1897. His parents, Anna and Alfonso Nasci, were a high-class Italian family, living in the urban center within the province Chieti. After studying in <bop>his<eop> birth city of Vasto, <bop>Spataro<eop> transferred to a boarding school called Montecassino in 1908, the adjustment to this new life made easier by the death of his father in 1910.
True	In Daniel's absence, however, Henrik enjoyed a high-scoring start to the season. On 14 November 2009, he scored his first NHL career hat-trick in an 8--2 win against the Colorado Avalanche. Leading up to Daniel's 22 November return, <bop>Henrik<eop> scored seven goals in seven games. <bop>He<eop> continued his pace into December, recording a League-leading 25 points (five goals, 20 assists) in 15 games to be named the NHL's First Star of the Month.
True	``The Resurrection of Lady Lester'' by OyamO (Charles F. Gordon) is a play and published book depicting Young's life; subtitled ``A Poetic Mood Song Based on the Legend of Lester Young''. In the 1986 film Round Midnight, the fictional main character Dale Turner, played by Dexter Gordon, was partly based on <bop>Young<eop> - incorporating flashback references to <bop>his<eop> army experiences, and loosely depicting his time in Paris and his return to New York just before his death.
False	In 1971, he published two volumes on the organic chemistry of palladium which were ``widely recognised as the most authoritative account of the organo-complexes of this metal''. Maitlis was elected a <bop>Fellow<eop> of the Royal Society in 1984. The citation highlights <bop>his<eop> work on the platinum group metals palladium, rhodium and iridium.
True	For four years following this Machiavellian political move, in effect the nation's first coup d'*tat, Flores continued to wield considerable power behind the scenes as commander of the military. President Rocafuerte's most lasting contribution was to begin development of a public school system. Although <bop>he<eop> had previously condemned Flores's violations of civil liberties, <bop>Rocafuerte<eop> argued that ``the backwardness of Ecuador makes enlightened despotism necessary.''
False	Smith shared outfield duties with Geissinger, Satterfield and Wisniewski, hitting .196 in 46 games while going 1-2 as a reliever. Grand Rapids advanced to the playoffs, but was swept by the South Bend Blue Sox in the best-of-three series on strong pitching by Jean Faut. Smith had a solid season in 1953, hitting .227 with 73 stolen bases and a .343 OBP in a career-high 114 games, being surpassed only by Fort Wayne's <bop>Betty Foss<eop> for the most stolen bases (80). <bop>She<eop> also posted career numbers in hits (91), runs (86), doubles (20), triples (5) and steals, while walking 71 times and tying for third in doubles.
False	Peaking at #27 in Canada's Alternative Rock chart in April 2013, the song 'Weird Science' by Toronto-based electro cock-rock band Most Non Heinous was co-written by Parsons. In the summer of 2012, Kebab was featured on the track Livin' Tonight by fellow Canadian modern rock act illScarlett. Parsons provided some production work to <bop>Elise LeGrow<eop> on <bop>her<eop> song 'Weed and Wine'.
True	When Murray broke his shoulder on the eve of Wolves' Championship play-off semi-final first leg against local rivals West Bromwich Albion, Hennessey stepped in to make his Wolves debut. With Murray sidelined for the whole of the 2007--08 season with yet another injury, <bop>Hennessey<eop> became firmly established at the club's number one, being an ever-present in the league. The season also saw <bop>him<eop> sign a new deal which will keep him at Molineux until Summer 2012.
False	This last show incarnation ended on November 19, 2010, when Ed Lover was released from the station and Mallette was reassigned to the midday shift, replacing De Ja. Troi Torain (born May 3, 1964), who previously worked at Power 105's rival hip-hop station WQHT with <bop>his<eop> half-brother <bop>Timothy Joseph<eop> (born January 3, 1979) who took Torain's old stage name ``Buc Wild'' until he switched to Power 105, is known as ``Star'' from the Star & Buc Wild morning show.
False	Baazi (Hindi: *****, Urdu: ****) is a 1984 Bollywood film directed by Raj N. Sippy. The film stars Dharmendra, Rekha, Mithun Chakraborty, Ranjeeta, Shakti Kapoor, Madan Puri and Mac Mohan. Ajay Sharma (Dharmendra), is a <bop>Police Inspector<eop> of notable wealth. <bop>He<eop> is happily married to Asha (Rekha) with two children.
True	Her police officer husband, good-natured Buddy, investigating the rumors of gay sex and drugs at the Watch with his partner Stan, is distracted by his burgeoning love affair with former high school classmate Sandra Anderson. Sandra just got back to the island and re-opened a coffee shop, her bad reputation as a promiscuous woman a painful fact in her life. Sandra's teenaged daughter <bop>Emily<eop> resentfully observes <bop>her<eop> mother's doings; she's hoping for a serious romance different from her mom's history, but her boyfriend may have more basic intentions.
False	Hardy and Bo team up and discover ways of profiting off of the wayward teens at school with deep pockets and even heavier issues. The unlikely duo's new business takes a unique turn when the students learn that Bo has more to offer than what meets the eye as the characters get tossed headfirst into the lifestyles of the rich and dysfunctional. Hardy fights to save <bop>Walter<eop> and fix <bop>his<eop> broken family while Bo's past comes back to haunt her.
True	The main catalyzer of the movement for national Jewish music, however, was Joel Engel. Engel, composer and music critic, was born outside the Pale of Jewish settlement, and was a completely assimilated Russian. A meeting with the Russian nationalist critic Vladimir Stasov inspired <bop>Engel<eop> to seek <bop>his<eop> Jewish roots.
False	The elite social group in Kenya known as the Happy Valley set was notorious for stories of drug use and promiscuous sexual encounters. These expatriates living in British East Africa received much publicity for their decadent hedonism. While Idina was married to <bop>Josslyn Hay<eop>, they frequented the Muthaiga Country Club in Nairobi. At Clouds, <bop>her<eop> house above the Rift Valley, Idina hosted wild all-night parties where patrons enjoyed champagne, cocaine, and wife-swapping.
True	Nelson specializes in rubber-faced comedy characters, much as Red Skelton did in his heyday. His most popular originals include Jiffy Jeff, a punchy prizefighter; Eppy Eppeman, a know-it-all geek with thick eyeglasses; an unnamed dumb football player; Wilby Stuckinsin, a hillbilly chicken farmer based on a life experience of Nelson's in Shreveport, Louisiana; and Mr. <bop>Pingyah<eop>, an argumentative Asian man who is more eloquent than the people <bop>he<eop> argues with.
False	He distinguished levels of logical reasoning, and introduced the notion of metalogic. Vasiliev spent 1912-13 in Western Europe (mostly Germany) and published his salient works ``Logic and Metalogic'' and ``Imaginary (non-Aristotelian) logic''. Vasiliev constructed non-Aristotelian logic using the concepts, and even the manner of reasoning, common to Aristotelian logic. <bop>He<eop> was aware of the achievement in mathematical logic (and even carefully studied <bop>Ernst Schr*der<eop> 's works) but did not make an attempt to formalise ``imaginary'' logic.
True	Though Blaisedell at first manages to assert his authority with his stolid demeanor and expert gunmanship, Abe McQuown and his troublesome gang of cowboys seek to antagonize him. One of McQuown's former associates, <bop>John ``Bud'' Gannon<eop>, hopes to repent for the horrors of <bop>his<eop> past by becoming a deputy sheriff in Warlock, while his younger brother Billy continues to ride with McQuown.
False	Some long games, such as Bannochburn Legacy, had more than 500 lines of code. To illustrate the style of these compendiums, here is the Table of Contents from Hartnell's Giant Book of Computer Games http://www.devili.iki.fi/library/publication/119.en.html: * Hartnell also wrote several how-to books about various genres of computer games, including Giant Book of Spectrum Games published in 1983, and also edited others, including <bop>Pete Shaw<eop> 's Creating Adventure Games On Your ZX Spectrum, also published in 1983. They were designed so that a beginner could, using <bop>his<eop> programs as examples, intuitively learn the BASIC programming language.
True	For the first time in its ten-year history, MoveOn.org endorsed a Presidential candidate when Obama received 70 percent of an online ballot the organization held of its members. On February 3, 2008, another member from the Kennedy family, First Lady of California <bop>Maria Shriver<eop>, announced <bop>her<eop> endorsement for Obama.
False	Sen. Clinton's campaign fired at least two campaign volunteers for forwarding related e-mails about Obama. Obama's campaign organization responded with a letter from Christian leaders vouching for his Christian faith, as well as with appeals to supporters to help correct any misunderstanding. From November 2007 to January 2008, as part of a drive to promote awareness of <bop>his<eop> Christian faith, Obama gave interviews to <bop>Pat Robertson<eop>'s Christian Broadcasting Network, to Christianity Today and to the religious website Beliefnet.com.
True	Both Wilde and Hopkins were deeply influenced by Pater's work. Wilde wrote of pederastic and homoerotic culture -- though not in the ``elevated'' pederastic sense that it held for Pater and Hopkins -- in a number of works. And though ``Hopkins often was, it must be admitted, strikingly Ruskinian in <bop>his<eop> love of Aristotelian particulars and their arrangements ... , it was at the foot of Pater -- the foremost Victorian unifier of 'eros, pedagogy, and aesthetics' -- that <bop>Hopkins<eop> would ever remain.''
True	Coghill spoke of Miranda's sudden change in character during an interview with Inside Soap stating that she felt Steve was always Miranda's rebound after the breakdown of her and Dean's romance. Coghill felt the plot had dug up old history for the pair and also noted it as the point <bop>Miranda<eop> finally comes to a decision to live <bop>her<eop> life freely, stating: ``Miranda's hesitant at first, but comes to realise she only has one life to live, and it's time for her to live it.''
False	Alison Kirbe is a young London girl who has just found out she has inherited a Texas ranch from an old soldier she had befriended during World War II.

False	``She spills coffee on herself with Cole, and then Todd, my dad, walks in on the two of them. Something innocent gets blown out of proportion, and then when Marty's pushed down the stairs, Cole automatically thinks it's Todd. It's been upsetting for Starr.'' Carlivati stated Hannah as being a ``real problem.'' Cole's incarceration for <bop>his<eop> brutal attack on ``Todd'' allows for the introduction of another love interest, <bop>James<eop> (Nic Robuck), the younger brother of Robert Ford (David A.

By the early twentieth century, some seventy years after <bop>his<eop> death, one biographer noted that more of Josiah Conder's hymns were in common use in Britain and the USA, than those of any other Congregational author except for the great Dr <bop>Isaac Watts<eop> and his friend Doddridge.
False	Paris regards them as looking weird. The contestants must then style themselves for the first ever Miss Paris Pageant. After each contestant presents themself to Paris Hilton and guest star Santino Rice, Paris puts Nicole, Katie, and Kristen up for elimination, along with Desirae. <bop>She<eop> then says TTYN to Katie and <bop>Kristen<eop>, and Katie shows her true colors, swearing at Paris and saying she's ``not as nice as everyone thinks (she) is''.
False	Hauk takes over his shows, but his corny humor and the polka music he plays lead to a flood of letters and phone calls demanding that Cronauer be put back on the air.

True	Desperate, Roman had the staff chemists create a product that was rushed to the market without proper testing, disfiguring several hundred women.

True	A Nazirite (******) was an Israelite who had taken special vows of dedication to Yahweh whereby he abstained for a specified period of time from using alcohol and grape products, cutting his hair, and approaching corpses. At the end of the period he was required to immerse himself in water.

True	After review, RMNB stands by its translation as the writers felt the professional translation and their own were nearly identical in meaning and therefore accurate. Leading into the Capitals 2011-12 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals matchup against the Boston Bruins, Hassett published an article discussing <bop>Tim Thomas<eop>'s performance after <bop>he<eop> snubbed the U.S. president Barack Obama during the Bruins' Stanley Cup celebration at the White House.
True	Galkin was nervous, and when Pelton asked him why, he said with humor that he had never been on CNN before referring to his career as a spy.

True	After breaking his own world record the following year, Moses lost to West Germany 's Harald Schmid on 26 August 1977 in Berlin, his fourth defeat in the 400-meter hurdles.

True	Clifton tells Perry that Eugene is running detention and preventing the sell of weed there, leading to reduced profits for Perry. Tahime proves to be an excellent strategist on the Chess board. Tahime invites another student (Peanut) in on the crimes they are engaged in. The principal receives an anonymous tip (from Perry) that <bop>Eugene<eop> is an ex-con and she is forced to fire <bop>him<eop>.
True	He also served on the staff of the Minnesota Ski-U-Mah, a scholastic publication. Jacobi met August Derleth in January 1931 when Derleth was visiting Minneapolis to see Donald Wandrei.

True	An Artists Edition was released by IDW Publishing in August 2013 and contains oversized reprints of the original art from issues 9 - 14 of the series. While these collections all contain the complete original series written by Mark Schultz, only the Kitchen Sink releases contain the backup stories written by <bop>Steve Stiles<eop>, though in 2012 Flesk Publications made it clear they were hunting for the original art from <bop>his<eop> stories for a future release.
False	He arranged for a justice of the peace and took out a marriage license on August 12, 1806. On August 16, he rode to Polly's house with family and friends, determined to ride off with Polly to be married elsewhere. Polly's father pleaded with Crockett to have the wedding in the <bop>Finley<eop> home. Crockett agreed only after Jean apologized for <bop>her<eop> past treatment of him.
False	She was so upset that she called off the wedding and their friends Paddy and Emily got married instead. However, Marlon and Tricia did eventually marry a few months later. Tricia was offered the chance to star in a Bollywood film and went to India for six months.

True	Other sources have explained Powell's injury differently; Miles Davis said Powell was beaten by a Savoy Ballroom bouncer after walking in the club without any money, while Dexter Gordon claimed he was beaten while in police custody after his arrest for drunk and disorderly conduct in a Philadelphia train station. Monk recorded ``In Walked Bud'' several times during his career, starting with the 1947 sessions later compiled for Genius of Modern Music (1951). According to music critic Robert Christgau, <bop>Monk<eop>'s rendition of the song for <bop>his<eop> 1958 live album Misterioso featured ``a long, laconically hilarious (and laconically, hilariously virtuosic) Johnny Griffin solo that's a landmark of saxophony''.
False	Tina's girlfriend, an attractive young Chinese woman named Maggie Lah, comes to visit him shortly thereafter. Maggie realises something is wrong on arriving at <bop>Tina<eop>'s apartment, as the front door has been left open, and enters the apartment trying not to attract notice. Koko realises <bop>she<eop> has entered but is not sure of her whereabouts.
False	His only criticism was that Dwight seemed too over-the-top, particularly while wielding a knife during the cold open lip dub. Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO Networks said that this was a good episode, but not an especially important one which failed to advance any ongoing story lines. Although <bop>he<eop> called scenes like <bop>Michael<eop> spanking Luke and his defense of Luke during the meeting as ``classic Scott'', Fitzpatrick also said the episode does little to start establishing a proper send-off for the character's final season.
False	Tsukasa works part-time at the sushi bar which is owned by her family, as well as her residence. Kohei falls in love with her if you cannot end up with any of the five heroines, which is known as the Bad End Route. Kaya is <bop>Erika<eop> and Iori's mother. Estimated to be at least 251 years old, yet <bop>she<eop> looks like a child, giving people the image that she is Iori and Erika's younger sister instead.
True	Later, he puts Kohei in charge of Athletic Meet as the new Student Council Officer. Kohei ends up with a lot of work in order to make the Athletic Meet a success. Haruna, Kanade, and Heiji arrive at evening tea time and encourage <bop>Kohei<eop> with <bop>his<eop> efforts.

False	However, after Korra was incapacitated and nearly rendered powerless by an enemy Amon, leader of a subversive movement who specialized in taking away the bending abilities of people, she revealed to Tenzin her deep-seated fears of Amon, crying on Tenzin's shoulder. Tenzin offered her comfort and a higher level of trust was established between the two. Later when Republic City came under attack from Amon's forces, Tenzin, <bop>his<eop> wife and their children were ultimately captured by Amon and were facing the real prospect of losing their bending when they were rescued by Korra and <bop>Mako<eop>.
True	He argues ejusdem generis that the Constitution's unenumerated rights (such as the 9th Amendment or the Privileges or Immunities clause of the 14th Amendment) are procedural in nature rather than substantive, thus protecting rights to democratic processes but not rights of a substantive nature. Justice Stone's Footnote Four from United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938) is a chief inspiration for Ely's theory of judicial review. In <bop>her<eop> recent book on Hans Kelsen, <bop>Sandrine Baume<eop> identified Ely as a significant defender of the ``compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy.''
False	(``It was not fair in me to take this Advantage,'' Franklin comments, ``and this I therefore reckon one of the first Errata of my life.'') James does, however, make it impossible for Ben to get work anywhere else in Boston. Sneaking onto a ship without <bop>his<eop> father's or brother's knowledge, Ben heads for New York City, but the printer <bop>William Bradford<eop> is unable to employ him; however, he tells Ben that his son Andrew, a Philadelphia printer, may be able to use him since one of his son's principal employees had just died.

Whenever the Fraggles comes into <bop>her<eop> view, Ma Gorg would scream causing Pa Gorg and Junior Gorg to try to catch the Fraggles or drive them away.
False	Uncle Traveling Matt (performed by Dave Goelz in the live-action series, voiced by <bop>Patrick Pinney<eop> in the animated series) -- Gobo's famous (as well as pompous, clumsy, and absent-minded) explorer uncle, spends most of the series in ``Outer Space'' (the Fraggles's perspective of the human world) and sends postcards back to <bop>his<eop> nephew describing his adventures there.
False	He sought without success a commission in the Massachusetts militia, mostly as a formality so that he could present it during his European travels. He continued to write essays (new ones and revisions to older ones), and published an updated version of his 1755 map.

False	The hard conditions of the war force Kirby to get even more strict with his exhausted pilots. He even refuses sick leave to men with malaria or to allow planes with problems to return to base. Tension between Griffin and Kirby soon peaks. Griffin recognizes the hardships <bop>Kirby<eop> faces, but <bop>he<eop> is often more driven by his sentimental side.
True	After a long convalescence, Rosenberg increasingly dedicated his time to teaching bel canto vocal technique and in 1995 with the help of Lars Bj*rling the great tenor's son, he returned to Sweden. In 2000, he was employed as a consulting vocal coach at the opera school in Gothenburg and in 2005 at Ersta Sk*ndal University College in Stockholm as Adjukt Professor. With the birth of <bop>his<eop> beloved son David, on Dec. 10th, 2004 (Stockholm) <bop>Rosenberg<eop> continues to teach, hold master classes, and perform in occasional concerts and recitals both in Sweden and Hungary where he resides since 2016.
True	His plan to invade Canada started with the Battle of Frenchman's Creek but was then abandoned because of problems due to poor organization. After arguing with Brigadier General Peter B. Porter, he challenged him to a duel, but both men went unscathed. The historian John R. Elting wrote of the duel, stating ``Unfortunately, both missed.''

False	A post that has been occupied and resigned by other missions, now falls to the lot of one of our colonists : and although the report of his success may not probably extend beyond the borders of our colony, yet we feel assured that his reward will be conferred in another and better world. Thomas Jackson was listed as a Reverend and probationer of the Methodist Church in the Journal of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church 1844--1847. Evidence of <bop>his<eop> missionary work was mentioned in the Journal of a tour of Governor <bop>John B Russwurm<eop> and Mr Stuart to the Saureekai, Toboe and Bolobo countries on October 4, 1843, published in the Maryland Colonization Journal:
False	A cover of ``Long Tall Sally'' followed in the spring of 1966, by which point the group had parted with Roman (who subsequently became program director of CKFH) and signed up with Bernie Finkelstein (later Bruce Cockburn's longstanding manager). However, shortly after a show at the El Patio on July 24, 1966, Marion left and subsequently recorded a solo single before moving into production work and playing with The Last Words. In <bop>his<eop> place, The Paupers recruited Scottish *migr* Adam Mitchell (born November 24, 1944 in Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland, resident of Bolton, Ontario) from the CommonFolk (a folk group featuring <bop>Doug Bush<eop>, Ian Rankin and Bruce Whitehead), apparently on an hour and a half's notice.
True	Maria Katinari ( ) was born in Chania on Crete as the oldest daughter of Antonios Katinaris. She is a Greek actress, singer and lyricist.

True	He is best known for his intense and sometimes controversial interpretations of opera, especially works by Italian composers and Richard Strauss. Sinopoli specialized in late-nineteenth century and early-twentieth century music, from Wagner and Verdi to Strauss, Mahler and the Second Viennese School. His conducting was the object of much controversy, especially in the symphonic genre, with some berating the ``eccentricity'' of his interpretations and even doubting his conducting abilities (in Norman Lebrecht's book The Maestro Myth Lebrecht interviewed many players who performed under <bop>Sinopoli<eop> who insisted that as a conductor <bop>he<eop> was actually incompetent) while others praised the insightfulness of his often intellectual approach to works.

False	April Clare Welsh of The Quietus stated: ``All shot through with the psychedelic heft of Neil Young & Crazy Horse, this is not a flash in the pan, a fumble in the dark or an album which loses its way but a cosmic paean to perfectionism that creates order out of the most beautiful chaos.'' Nevertheless, Ryan Bray of Consequence of Sound was rather mixed in <bop>his<eop> review, stating: ``From the lean, scrappy production value to the grandiose guitar solos and Alex Coxen's wobbling, vocal delivery a la <bop>Grant Hart<eop>, the record has the messy fingerprints of indie rock's cherished first wave smeared all over it.''
False	He was engaged in a series of amorous episodes with women in Nadezhda von Meck's large household, which caused her to become markedly cold towards him. He asked her for some financial assistance, but she refused. Tchaikovsky instead came to his aid, despite having been accused by Kotek of having revealed to her the true nature of their relationship.

One day, AJ finds out all <bop>Reggie<eop>'s secrets, and gets <bop>him<eop> so drunk that he has liver-fail.
True	Cake margarines and shortenings tend to contain a few percent of monoglycerides whereas other margarines typically have less. Such ``high ratio shortenings'' blend better with hydrophilic ingredients such as starches and sugar. Hydrogenation of organic substances was first developed by the French chemist Paul Sabatier in 1897, and in 1901 the German chemist <bop>Wilhelm Normann<eop> developed the hydrogenation of fats, which <bop>he<eop> patented in 1902.
True	However, Elena also realizes that Navarro will try to kill C*sar, and sends Miguel to warn his father of the assassination. Unfortunately, he arrives too late; both C*sar and the assassin have been killed, leaving no link back to Navarro. Navarro briefly returns to the house to gloat before addressing the crowd outside, promising that <bop>C*sar<eop> will be treated as a hero and <bop>his<eop> family will be taken care of.
False	Matilda Sissieretta Joyner was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, United States, to Jeremiah Malachi Joyner, an African Methodist Episcopal minister, and <bop>Henrietta Beale<eop>.

False	Considered as one of the finest cricketers to ever play for New Zealand, Guptill is the first cricketer from New Zealand and the fifth overall to score a double century in a One Day International match. He currently holds the record of highest individual score in World Cup and the second highest score in One Day Internationals of 237* runs. His wife is radio host, New Zealand Herald Focus co-host and Sky Sport sidelines reporter Laura McGoldrick, while <bop>his<eop> mother-in-law, Leanne McGoldrick is Martin's agent, and a family friend of <bop>Martin Crowe<eop>, as Crowe became a mentor to Guptill and Ross Taylor.
True	However, the Anglo-Danish king instead made his son Sveinn a viceroy, in effect placing his mother *lfgifu in charge of his recent conquest. This greatly infuriated Einarr. As the pressure grew more intense on <bop>him<eop> during Sveinn Knutsson 's viceroy reign, <bop>Einar<eop> made his greatest political masterstroke.
False	McCluskey a tale of how Edie had told her that she gave Travers away only to provide him with the best. The wives distribute Edie's ashes all over Wisteria Lane. This episode is narrated by Nicollette Sheridan as the late Edie Britt. Susan tries to console Dave after <bop>Edie<eop>'s death by telling him about <bop>her<eop> and Mike's car accident in which she was driving the car, and not Mike, and felt incredibly guilty after killing Lila and Paige.
False	Watford(edit) Page started his professional career at Watford in 1993, having been with the club from the age of 11. He established himself as a key member of the first team under manager Kenny Jackett, playing 42 games in the 1996--97 campaign. <bop>His<eop> first major feat with the club came in the 1997--98 season, when new manager <bop>Graham Taylor<eop> appointed Page as captain and led the ``Hornets'' to the Second Division title.

False	Huthart made her first appearance on Gladiators in 1994, and went on to become the female series champion that year. In the Grand Final, she and Kerryn Sampey had an exciting Eliminator where Huthart fell down the Travelator twice and <bop>Sampey<eop> was able to pass <bop>her<eop>, but she fell down it too.
False	Huthart's time as a Gladiator was brief, however, as she wanted to represent her country in the Ashes series in Australia where she lost to her opponent from the domestic series final, Kerryn Sampey in the final. However, Huthart returned to win the 1995 Battle of the Champions, beating Australia's Bernie Withers in an exciting Eliminator which was almost a repeat of the domestic series final against <bop>Kerryn Sampey<eop>; Huthart fell down the Travelator the first time <bop>she<eop> ran up it, allowing Bernie to pass her, but she slipped down it as well, and Huthart was able to reach the top and earn the victory.
True	He would go on to take the captain's armband for numerous matches while with the Jambos due to the unavailability of *ali*kas. One such occasion came on 7 May 2011 as he was sent off for a challenge on Nikica Jelavi* in a 4-0 away loss against Rangers. During <bop>his<eop> Hearts career, <bop>Eggert<eop> made 153 appearances in all competitions and scored nine goals.
False	On 22 November 2008, Ukrainian Canadians marked the beginning of National Holodomor Awareness Week. Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism Minister Jason Kenney attended a vigil in Kiev.

False	She filled up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Hellenic Olympic Committee, as Greece received an automatic berth for being the host nation. Amassed the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall, Vryoni was haplessly pinned by Ukraine's <bop>Svetlana Saenko<eop> in <bop>her<eop> opening match, but bounced back to defeat Mongolia's Ochirbatyn Burmaa with an arduous 3--4 decision.
True	A frequent social -- and then romantic -- Elm Tree Road visitor was Bettine (Athalia) Stokes Edwards, an American girl who danced in Chu Chin Chow (and daughter of Robert Ewing Edwards of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) who became Mercer's first wife. The New York Times announcement of their engagement (28 August 1919) states: ``Mr & Mrs Glover Fitzhugh Perin of 57 West Fifty-eight street have announced the engagement of Mrs Perin's oldest daughter <bop>Miss Bettine Stokes Edwards<eop>... '' suggesting that <bop>her<eop> father either was dead or divorced; her remarried mother then lived in New York City.
True	One writer noted that nothing had been moved or replaced, changed, or modernized, from the books in the library to the appliances in the kitchen and the fixtures in the bathrooms. Noted columnist Jack Smith visited the estate in 1973 and wrote that ``time stood still'', as <bop>Lloyd<eop>'s clothes still hung in <bop>his<eop> closet, and the master bedroom and living room ``looked like a set for a movie of the 1930s.''
False	The article declares that Manhigut will never ``bow to political correctness'', and that ``MK Moshe Feiglin understands this concept very well''. Sackett had close ties with Rabbis Meir and Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane, and there are several ideological similarities. Feiglin advocates encouraging emigration of all <bop>Arabs<eop> under Israel's jurisdiction, with financial incentives. <bop>He<eop> supports annexing all parts of the Land of Israel under Israeli control, developing a legal system more consistent with Jewish values, and restricting Israeli citizenship to Jews and those non-Jews loyal to the State of Israel.
True	Leacock would teach at MIT until his retirement in 1989. In 1989 he moved to Paris, where he met Valerie Lalonde and, together, they made Les Oeufs a la Coque de Richard Leacock (84 minutes), the first major film shot with a tiny Video-8 Handycam to be broadcast on prime-time television in France. Leacock and Lalonde continued making films of their own choice without the pressures of TV producers, notably A Musical Adventure in Siberia, in collaboration with conductor Sarah Caldwell, his daughter Victoria Leacock and filmmaker Vincent Blanchet. <bop>Leacock<eop> died on 23 March 2011 at age the age of 89 in Paris. Before <bop>his<eop> death, he was raising funds for his multi-format memoir, The Feeling of Being There - A Filmmaker's Memoir, a bound paper book and DVB (digital video book), published by Seme*on Editions.
True	Descartes specifically said that error comes about because the will is not limited to judging things which the understanding is limited to, and described the possibility of such judging or choosing things ignorantly, without understanding them, as free will. Under the influence of Bacon and Descartes, <bop>Thomas Hobbes<eop> made one of the first attempts to systematically analyze ethical and political matters in a modern way. <bop>He<eop> defined will in his Leviathan Chapter VI, in words which explicitly criticize the medieval scholastic definitions:
False	In Sacrifice Kyle Katarn voices his disbelief that Boba Fett was staying neutral and was concerned with the fact that GA forces had assassinated Dur Gejjen, Corellian Prime Minister. In Inferno Kyle Katarn, Kenth Hamner and <bop>Kyp Durron<eop> stand up to Jacen Solo at Mara's funeral, telling <bop>him<eop> to take a seat in the Jedi Knights row.
True	Swick's first fight in the show came during the semi-finals. He faced Stephan Bonnar, but was defeated by triangle armbar at 4:55 of the first round, eliminating him from the show. At The Ultimate Fighter 1 Finale, Swick defeated Alex Schoenauer by knockout just 20 seconds into the first round, earning the nickname ``Quick'' from UFC announcer Mike Goldberg. Though <bop>he<eop> had lost the show, <bop>Swick<eop> signed a contract with the UFC.
False	Carrillo developed an easy method for notation, which would help people not familiar with previous forms of notation to quickly learn to read and write music. To show how easy the new writing system was, Carrillo gave two New York elementary school boys, who had no prior knowledge of Sonido 13, a simple work by <bop>Bach<eop> to convert to <bop>his<eop> notation system.
False	With the win, the Colts improved to 7--0 for the fourth time in five seasons and they set a franchise record with 15 consecutive regular season wins. Also, quarterback Peyton Manning (31/48 for 347 yards) joined Dan Marino, Brett Favre, and <bop>John Elway<eop> as the only players in NFL history to complete 4,000 career passes. In addition, <bop>he<eop> became the fastest to reach the milestone as he reached it in 183 games.
True	In the 1990 NFL Draft he was selected in the ninth round by the Minnesota Vikings. His rookie year, he was the second string running back behind Herschel Walker.

True	SENSE OF WONDER n. a feeling of awakening or awe triggered by an expansion of one's awareness of what is possible or by confrontation with the vastness of space and time, as brought on by reading science fiction. Jon Radoff has characterised a sense of wonder as an emotional reaction to the reader suddenly confronting, understanding, or seeing a concept new in the context of new information. In the introductory section of <bop>his<eop> essay 'On the Grotesque in Science Fiction', <bop>Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr.<eop>, Professor of English, DePauw University, states:
False	She is best remembered today for portraying Brang*ne in the world premiere of Richard Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde in 1865 and Helmwige in the premiere of Wagner's Die Walk*re in 1869.

True	The company paid Tamagno a cash advance of 2000 pounds sterling to make his first lot of ``78s''. He also received royalties from the company for every individually numbered, custom-labelled pressing that sold. Roland Gelatt's revised edition of The Fabulous Phonograph (Collier Books, New York, 1977, p.*119) asserts that <bop>Tamagno<eop>'s recording contract, signed in December 1902, was the first to embody ``the royalty principle''. Gelatt states that Tamagno approved 19 recordings from <bop>his<eop> Ospedaletti session for release to the public.
True	Jean de Bourbon (1381--1434) was Duke of Bourbon, from 1410 to his death and Duke of Auvergne since 1416. He was the eldest son of Louis II and Anna d'Auvergne. Through <bop>his<eop> mother, <bop>John<eop> inherited the County of Forez.
False	AlAhly refused again to let go of El-Hadary, but El-Hadary refused to let go of his final chance to explore new horizons, so he ended unilaterally his contract with Al-Ahly in an event that was the most debating in the Egyptian football history for months. The case of El-Hadary vs. Al-Ahly vs. FC Sion is being ruled by FIFA until the time these lines were written. During his stint at Al-Ahly, El-Hadary had the best chance to be trained by <bop>Ahmed Nagy<eop> so <bop>he<eop> achieved some impressive feats in over 500 appearances for the club in which he scored 1 goal.
True	Savile was four times married: to Jane, daughter of Richard Garth of Morden, Surrey, by whom he had issue a son Henry, and two daughters; to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Wentworth of North Elmsall, Yorkshire, by whom he had issue John (died 1651), who was heir to his half-brother Henry, and great-grandfather of John Savile, 1st Earl of Mexborough (1720--1778); to Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Wentworth (died 1551), and widow of Sir W.

False	This was followed by further works as executive and line producer before he started in 1996 on a project to develop a cultural centre in the city of Z*rich. Boesiger is currently active again as producer and writer of various English language projects. In particular 'Rafiq & Judith' is in development and is planned for production summer 2017. Besides <bop>his<eop> main career as a producer, Johannes Boesiger was active between 1989 and 1995 on the management board of the Locarno International Film Festival, co-founder of the Carl Mayer Scriptwriting award in Graz, Austria, and lately in 2007 together with <bop>Dieter Kosslick<eop>, was one of the initiators of the section ``culinary cinema'' at the Berlin International Film Festival today directed by Thomas Struck.
True	After Gettysburg, Webb received command of the division six weeks later and led it through the fall campaigns. His division played a prominent role in the Battle of Bristoe Station. When Gibbon returned to command in the spring of 1864, <bop>Webb<eop> went back to brigade command for the Overland Campaign. At the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, in May, <bop>he<eop> was hit by a bullet that passed through the corner of his right eye and came out his ear, but did not impair his mental abilities.
False	The obolus, along with the mirror, was a symbol of new schismatic heretics in the short story ``The Theologians'' by Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges. In the story's discussion of the circularity of time, eternity, and the transmigration of the soul through several bodies the author uses a quote of Luke 12:59, mistranslated as ``no one will be released from prison until <bop>he<eop> has paid the last obolus'' since <bop>Luke<eop> calls the coin a lepton (a somewhat smaller denomination) rather than an obolus.
False	This was the infamous occasion when Woodgate entered the event twice, using the name Wat Bradford in the other entry when he partnered another Kingstonian M M Brown. The rules of entry at the regatta were subsequently revised to prevent this. Corrie partnered M M Brown in 1867 to win Silver Goblets again. In 1870 Corrie partnered <bop>E Hall<eop> for <bop>his<eop> third win of SIlver Goblets.
False	Many action were too dangerous for Li because he has passed down his physical prime despite being a wushu champion. Jet Li also hurt his ankle badly on the set so Hung had to perform a lot of action. Hung was then <bop>Li<eop>'s stunt double again in the sequel, Once Upon a Time in China II. <bop>He<eop> was also featured a role as the leader of the White Lotus Sect.
False	Robert Martin died in 1355, his wife surviving him until 1373, when the manor passed to her eldest son by her first husband, Sir Walter de Romsey. It then passed by inheritance into the Keilway family, it being held by John Keilway on his death in 1547. His son Francis died in 1601--2, and <bop>his<eop> son Thomas succeeded to Rockbourne, which, already heavily mortgaged to Sir <bop>Anthony Ashley<eop>, he sold in 1608 to Sir Anthony's son-in-law, Sir John Cooper.
False	The party was founded in 1969, by Tom Burgess a disaffected former Liberal MHA who crossed the floor to become an independent when he was passed over for a cabinet seat. He was re-elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from Labrador West in the 1971 provincial election under the New Labrador Party banner. The election returned a hung parliament. Burgess initially indicated that <bop>he<eop> would support the opposition Progressive Conservative Party's bid to form a government and unseat Premier Joey Smallwood's Liberals but, days after Conservative leader <bop>Frank Moores<eop> was sworn in as Premier, Burgess was enticed to rejoin the Liberals under the false promise that he would succeed Joey Smallwood as Liberal leader and Premier.
False	Bergen successfully convinces Hilary to fly into Wistful Vista. Meanwhile, Jerry and Marge, still searching for Julie, have decided that they are still in love and get married. Back at the McGees', Molly discovers that Julie is in love with <bop>Bergen<eop> and advises <bop>her<eop> to ``sabotage'' him into marriage.
True	Gilbert Cruz of Entertainment Weekly called the book ``half an account of Ken's life-halting obsession with reconstructing his mythical older brother and half the biography that David always expected as a soon-to-be-famous author.'' Matthew Sweet of The Independent wrote, ``<bop>Ken Dornstein<eop>'s project--<bop>his<eop> researches and the book that they have become--is both a loving tribute to the memory of his dead brother and an act of destruction and erasure...
False	Sullivan never had sought elective office when, in 1986, he ran for and won the Democratic nomination for governor. Many observers believed that, following three terms with a Democratic governor (Ed Herschler) the chances for another Democrat to gain that post would be remote. Nonetheless, after a hard-fought campaign, Sullivan defeated Republican nominee <bop>Peter K.<eop> Simpson. In <bop>his<eop> 1990 reelection, he defeated the rancher and businesswoman Mary Hansen Mead of Jackson, daughter of former Republican Governor and U.S. Senator Clifford P. Hansen.
True	At age 14 Franks bought his first guitar, a Japanese Marco Polo for $29.95 with six private lessons included - the only music education that he received. At University High in Irvine, Franks discovered the poetry of <bop>Theodore Roethke<eop> with <bop>his<eop> off-rhymes and hidden meter.
False	Robertson's pioneering, unconventional use of the wah-pedal as an extension of the instrument during soloing rather than as a purely rhythmic effect provided a boost to the band as well. In 1978 Robertson finally left the band and was replaced by guitarist <bop>Gary Moore<eop>, whom <bop>he<eop> had replaced in 1974.
False	Both seem relieved by this mutual honesty on difficult topics. At a gas station, Tony spots Fabian Petrulio, a former member of the DiMeo crime family who turned FBI informant and was relocated under the Witness Protection Program. Tony resolves to locate and execute Petrulio while continuing his trip with Meadow. After leaving <bop>his<eop> daughter at a college bar, Tony confirms <bop>Petrulio<eop>'s identity when he sees a bust of Ronald Reagan in his office, similar to those Petrulio had sculpted while in prison.
False	In all, Miller wrote twice the number of opinions as any of his colleagues on the Court, leading future Chief Justice William Rehnquist to describe him as ``very likely the dominant figure'' on the Court in his time. When Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died in 1873, attorneys and law journals across the country lobbied for <bop>Miller<eop> to be appointed to succeed <bop>him<eop>, but President Ulysses Grant was determined to appoint an outsider.
True	The firm of Triebert, which was the dominant oboe-making concern in mid-19th century France, fell to pieces with the death of sole proprietor Fr*d*ric Triebert in 1879. By 1882 it had changed management thrice and was eventually sold to the mass-maker Gautrot, itself purchased in 1884 by Couesnon. Fr*d*ric Triebert's last foreman, <bop>Fran*ois Lor*e<eop> (1835-1902), formed <bop>his<eop> own oboe making company in 1881, carrying on Triebert's work and tradition.
True	Buckner was raised in Detroit, where he played very early in his career before joining McKinney's Cotton Pickers.

False	There he became acquainted with John Smeaton, who during the course of his studies on windmills had devised a descriptive scale for grading wind speed. This scale was included in the paper for which he was awarded the Copley Medal. In Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale and How a 19th-Century Admiral Turned Science into Poetry author Scott Huler relates that <bop>Dalrymple<eop>'s voyages had convinced <bop>him<eop> that a standard scale for measuring the speed of wind at sea would be of great value to sailors, and that he had included Smeaton's scale in his work Practical Navigation, which was written around 1790 but never published.
True	In an article in Contemporary Authors, published two years before her first full-length book of poetry, Finch made a remark that anticipates the focus of her career ``To me, poetic form, with its unverbal, physical power, is radically important in reconnecting us with our human roots and rediscovering our intimacy with nature . . .. rhythmic formal poetry is of great value in celebrating, commemorating, and cementing the bonds of community.'' As Claire Keyes notes in the entry on <bop>Finch<eop> in Scribner's American Writers, ``A strong current in <bop>her<eop> work is the decentering of the self, a theme which stems from her deep connection with the natural world and her perception of the self as part of nature.''
False	In preparation for his fight with Bisping, Akiyama switched to Jackson's Submission Fighting in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is unclear whether the switch is permanent. Even though Akiyama lost to <bop>Bisping<eop>, <bop>he<eop> rocked him in the first round.

False	Having disposed of Sue, Rivers takes Maud to London to Mrs Sucksby's house. There Maud learns that <bop>Mrs Sucksby<eop> is the mastermind behind <bop>her<eop> escape and Sue's downfall.
False	Marianne Lilly, before being incarcerated in the asylum by her evil brother, changed her will, leaving one half of her wealth to her own daughter, Susan, and the other half to Maud. Mrs Sucksby explains to Maud that she has no choice but to comply with the rest of the plan. Maud is further devastated to learn that they have no intention of rescuing <bop>Sue<eop> from the asylum. Acknowledging the wrong <bop>she<eop> has done, Maud knows she must escape Mrs Sucksby if she is to rescue Sue.
True	When she does, she finds out that she doesn't have the same blood type as him, implying that he may not be her real, biological father.

False	His songs (for example, ``Hey Bo Diddley'' and ``Who Do You Love?``) often have no chord changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic tension and release.

True	While traveling via bus to Hal's house in Peachtree County the group stop at a drug store, where Granny Ruth meets local sheriff Andrew Griffin while Duane, attempting to wriggle out a bus window, meets the sheriff's daughter Opal, who he tries to convince help him and Belial escape.

False	A few days later, Isabel sees Graeme in a pub, and phones Ian, who comes to the pub and confirms that Graeme is the man in his memory. Isabel is certain that <bop>Rose Macloed<eop> has been lying about Rory's not having been an organ donor, perhaps in order to protect Graeme. <bop>She<eop> asks her journalist friend Angus to speak to his contacts at the hospital, and he confirms that the young donor of Ian's heart was named Macloed.
True	She visits Rory's mother, Rose, and meets Rose's partner Graeme, who perfectly fits Ian's description of the possible killer. However, Rose insists that Rory was not an organ donor. That evening, Jamie and his lover Louise visit <bop>Isabel<eop>, who is determined to be polite; but <bop>her<eop> jealousy gets the better of her and she is rude to Louise, who leaves with Jamie.
False	Isabel tells Ian about the second Macloed family, and they go together to tell Euan about his son's heart. Afterwards, Ian informs Isabel that he visited West Linton shortly after his operation, and spoke to several people there. From this Isabel concludes that Ian must have seen <bop>Euan<eop>, heard about <bop>his<eop> son's death, and subconsciously connected Euan's face with his new heart.
False	Grace Ruiz starred in The Chase (BBC 2006) as <bop>Daisy Williams<eop>. <bop>She<eop> is the daughter of Yvonne Francas, who is the sister of Gaynor Faye, meaning that Grace plays her real life Auntie's daughter in BBC1 drama The Chase.

True	Roosevelt also produced the film Pot o' Gold and distributed the British film Pastor Hall. During his Hollywood period, Roosevelt became involved with Joseph Schenck, the movie mogul who funnelled mob money to the Democratic Party. Schenck also lent money for Roosevelt's movie.

Bigby had the Packers' first 2008 interception in season opener against the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football, picking off quarterback <bop>Tarvaris Jackson<eop> in the fourth quarter. <bop>He<eop> played in just seven games during the season due to injuries and was placed on season-ending injured reserve with a shoulder injury on December 18.
False	Selling the audience on both a relationship and its breakup is a pretty impressive feat for one episode to pull off and Jerrika Hinton deserves a lion's share of the credit for that. `` Writing for ''At Last``, Siede was disappointed that the relationship between Kyle and <bop>Stephanie<eop> wasn't explored more but enjoyed the chemistry between the characters, as well as the tragedy of his death. <bop>She<eop> noted the ''quiet dignity to Stephanie's grief that I'm excited to see Hinton explore in the future.
False	`` On a more critical note, Lauren Hoffman for Cosmopolitan felt that while she enjoyed Hinton's performance, Edwards was underutilized compared to earlier interns like ''George and <bop>Izzie<eop>`` and that it was ''hard to make a character you only really get to play every few weeks feel like yours and I understand why (Jerrika is) moving on. I'm also happy <bop>her<eop> character got to do so without getting murdered or fired, although she's probably going to be legitimately traumatized by the part where she burned a rapist to death?
True	On Stephanie's decision to end the relationship, Hinton said, ``She has to let it go and walk away because of the pure reality of the situation: <bop>Kyle<eop> came to her as a sick person and while they were able to mitigate some of that, the circumstances of <bop>his<eop> illness mean that he will continue to deteriorate, which means he'll continue to require more care.
False	Christine of Saxony (25 December 1505 -- 15 April 1549) was a German noble, landgravine of <bop>Hesse<eop>. <bop>She<eop> was the regent of Hesse in 1547-1549.
True	First owned by Gene Sens, WZLE's first studios were located in what was formerly a shoe store at the Sheffield Shopping Center.

When asked what he had done, he told the officer ``I killed <bop>her<eop>''.
True	``TV Party'' is driven by Chuck Dukowski's bass line and features Henry Rollins on lead vocals and bellowed backing vocals from band members. The song is light in comparison to other songs from the band's Damaged era.

False	Throughout the act, Wilma vents some of her frustration at Fred through her lines, while Fred himself realizes the parallels between Scrooge's past and his own recent behavior. During the next scene, at Fezziwig's Christmas party, Betty informs Wilma that <bop>Maggie<eop> has come down with the Bedrock Bug as well; Wilma dons <bop>her<eop> costume and plays Belle.
False	Wilma dons her costume and plays Belle. The rest of the play proceeds as normal: Ernie, a cheerful Bedrock citizen, plays the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Fred, witnessing <bop>Barney<eop>, Betty, Bamm-Bamm, and Pebbles playing the Cragits, continues to realize the depths of <bop>his<eop> recent self-absorption.
True	Alistair Cookie is Cookie Monster's alter ego when hosting ``Monsterpiece Theater'' on Sesame Street.

False	He was instituted by Bishop Thomas Sprat, but his installation was put off when it was discovered that he had taken no higher degree than M.A., and the statutes required that he should be at least B.D. Although he took the degree of D.D, 18 January 1689, he was not installed, and William III shortly afterwards appointed Henry Ullock in his place. Lowth declined the oath of allegiance to <bop>William<eop>, and was in consequence suspended from <bop>his<eop> functions in August 1689, and in the following February deprived of both his livings; he made a fraudulent agreement with his successor in the vicarage.
True	While Carlos Ancona is fictional, his father Eligio Ancona and his brother Antonio Ancona are historical figures, and are the great-great-grandfather and great-grandfather, respectively, of author Rosa Hugener.

True	``In the early spring he stood above the heights of Miles Canyon ... the line 'I have gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else to gaze on' came into his mind and again he hammered out a complete poem, ``The Call of the Wild''. Conversations with locals led Service to write about things he had not seen (some of which had not actually happened) as well. He did not set foot in Dawson City until 1908, arriving in the Klondike ten years after the Gold Rush when his renown as a writer was already established. After having collected enough poems for a book, Service ``sent the poems to his father, who had emigrated to Toronto, and asked him to find a printing house so they could make it into a booklet. He enclosed a cheque to cover the costs and intended to give these booklets away to his friends in Whitehorse'' for Christmas. His father took the manuscript to William Briggs in Toronto, whose employees loved the book. ``The foreman and printers recited the ballads while they worked. A salesman read the proofs out loud as they came off the typesetting machines.`` An ''enterprising salesman sold 1700 copies in advance orders from galley proofs.`` The publisher ''sent <bop>Robert<eop>'s cheque back to <bop>him<eop> and offered a ten percent royalty contract for the book.`
True	President made a cartel of Duke of Montrose, putting all of President's prisoners from three earlier captures, on board and then sending her and her now 79 passengers and crew into Falmouth under the command of an American officer. There the British government refused to recognize the cartel agreement that Blewett, his crew, and passengers had signed. Rather than turn Duke of Montrose over to the Agent for American Prisoners, the British government instructed <bop>Blewett<eop> to resume command of <bop>his<eop> ship and prepare her to sail again.
True	Clea revealed to the inhabitants of the Dark Dimension that her mother didn't care for her subjects at all and was willing to endanger them to defeat Clea. The population became convinced that Clea should be the ruler and the ``Flames of Regency'' appeared on Clea's head. The Flames of Regency made Clea powerful enough to defeat and banish <bop>Umar<eop> and <bop>her<eop> father Orini from the Dark Dimension, and Clea took the throne of the Dark Dimension.
False	This prompted the release of Brooks' 2013 album, Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences. Following his retirement from the music industry in 2002, Garth Brooks rarely performed outside occasional events, such as a series in Kansas City and benefit concerts in Los Angeles. Despite <bop>his<eop> original intention to remain officially retired until 2014, Brooks, along with wife Trisha Yearwood, received an offer from <bop>Steve Wynn<eop> to perform a residency show at his Encore Theatre in Las Vegas.
True	Three of the more famous horses were world champions. Joe Young (known as the ``iron horse'') sold for $10,000 by C.E. Westbrook, the first horse west of the Mississippi River to sell for such a high price. Joe Young sired <bop>Joe Patchen<eop> in 1889, who earned <bop>his<eop> owner $40,000 in race purses and then was sold for $44,000.
True	Luo is grouped with Wang Bo, Yang Jiong (**/**) and Lu Zhaolin (***/***) as one of the Four Greats of the Early Tang as the most outstanding writers of their time. It was said that Luo Binwang could recite poetry when he was six years old. In adulthood, after a period serving on the staff of Li Yuanqing (***) Prince of Dao, an uncle of then-ruling Emperor Gaozong, <bop>Luo<eop> worked in the central government in Chang'an from 665. In 670, <bop>he<eop> was exiled to Xinjiang, after which he travelled to Yunnan with the army.
False	Bob Todd (1) makes an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in Again Doctor. He also appeared in the 1970 Carry On Again Christmas TV special. Nikki van der Zyl (2) was one of British cinema's most prolific voice-over artistes, dubbing many of the original Bond girls (including <bop>Shirley Eaton<eop> in Goldfinger). <bop>She<eop> appears unaccredited in two of the films, none of them dubbing work.
False	His most memorable role was in Cleo where he played Marcus to Warren Mitchell's Spencius. He had other roles in Spying, Doctor, Henry, Abroad, and Emmannuelle. He also appeared uncredited in Follow That Camel. Anthony Sagar (7) had several minor roles from <bop>Sergeant<eop> to Loving, <bop>his<eop> role in Constable being uncredited.
False	Batholomew agreed that Vitkovic was criminally insane at the time of the shooting and said Vitkovic could have identified with Rambo and the Hoddle Street killings. After hearing representations by counsel representing the building tenants directly affected, the families of those killed, and news media organisations, the coroner Hal Hallenstein refused to suppress publication of photographs taken from a 5th-floor security video that showed <bop>Vitkovic<eop>. <bop>He<eop> said those images would be made public at the end of the inquest.
True	Morey told the show's official website that Sonya entered Callum's life, not to get him back, but to see if he was okay. However, she then fell in love with Toadie. When she was asked how Callum does not remember his mother, Morey explained that <bop>Sonya<eop> had fallen in with a bad crowd and had become addicted to alcohol and drugs, when <bop>she<eop> had Callum.
False	Mainz Cathedral was the coronation site for Philip of Swabia, for Frederick II, and anti-king Henry Raspe. Speyer Cathedral is the world's largest preserved Romanesque church (after the demolition of Cluny Abbey) and today a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built starting about 1025 by King Conrad II as a family vault for the ruling Salian dynasty. <bop>His<eop> successor Henry III donated the Speyer Gospels in 1046; the building was completed in 1061 under the rule of King Henry IV. During the Investiture Controversy with <bop>Pope<eop> Gregory VIII, he had the church again extended from 1081, in order to stress his Imperial authority.
True	Rajkumar plays Dr Murthy, surgeon, who is also a Singer by hobby. On a visit to Ernakulam for a medical conference, Murthy's father advises him to stay at Retd Major subbanna's Balakrishna house, who is old-friend. Due to a mishap by <bop>his<eop> assistant, <bop>Murthy<eop> has to act as compounder and his assistant has to act as Doctor.
True	He was called to the Ontario bar in 1967 and practiced private law at Wright & McTaggart and its successor firms until 1982, at which point he went to work as Associate Deputy Minister of Justice for the Government of Canada. In 1986, he went on to practice at McCarthy T*trault, until he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1998, replacing Justice John Sopinka. Just as with <bop>his<eop> predecessor, <bop>Binnie<eop> had never sat as a judge before his appointment to the Supreme Court.
False	Tiro is dispatched off to meet with Caelius Rufus, who is now working for Crassus, to find out what his plans are. Rufus, who dislikes old baldhead intensely, agrees to hide Tiro in a secret panel behind a tapestry during an important meeting. About twenty important men meet at Crassus'' house, including <bop>Caesar<eop> and Catilina, and on <bop>his<eop> return to Cicero they work together on his transcribed notes, finding out that the conspirators plan to seize control of the state, introduce a land reform bill, sell of vast amounts of conquered land abroad and then annexe Egypt for further acquisition of land in Italy for the plebeians.
True	His sister, Susan Linn Sage (1866--1933) married James Fenimore Cooper (1858--1938), grandson of prolific author James Fenimore Cooper (1789--1851). Susan and James were the parents of Paul Fenimore Cooper (1899--1970), an author and <bop>Henry<eop>'s nephew. After graduation from Yale, <bop>he<eop> began working in the lumber business, like his father and grandfather.
True	``Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand: her opponents have observed that in the event of a nuclear war, the two things that will emerge from the rubble are the cockroaches and Helen Clark.'' The Dominion Post reported that Helen Clark found the anecdote amusing and suggested <bop>Mrs Clinton<eop> should talk to <bop>her<eop> husband, former US president Bill Clinton.
False	Her two-day visit to Washington D.C. included a meeting and lunch at the White House with President George W Bush (as well as other senior Bush Administration officials), and meetings with the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, the Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, the US Trade Representative, <bop>Susan Schwab<eop>, and the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Mike McConnell. <bop>She<eop> also made calls on the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Barbara Boxer, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
True	The painting has been described as one of D*rer's most unpopular works, with many art historians, including Max Friedl*nder and Erwin Panofsky, commenting unfavourably on apparent qualities such as ``austerity and awkwardness''. Art historian Fedja Anzelewsky described her as ``a parody rather than an exaltation of the classical feminine figure.'' The feminist scholar Linda Hults observes how ``there is a mechanical quality to <bop>Lucretia<eop>'s suicidal gesture; it seems to operate apart from <bop>her<eop> facial expression, and it does not seem to require the assistance of her other arm, which is oddly placed behind her back.''
False	By romanticizing Cort*s as the discoverer of Mexico and the destroyer of Aztec immorality (human sacrifice), Calder*n participates in this initial ``discovery'' herself, ignoring Cort*s'' brutalities of conquest, and mythicizing the Mexican landscape as a Paradise comparable to the Biblical Eden through its sublimity. In doing so, she highlights Mexico's ``unexploited'' resources, which would become part of the motivation for the United States' invasion of Mexico. Despite <bop>her<eop> identification with Cort*s, Calder*n's later description of Chapultepec implies a greater affinity for Cort*s'' indigenous mistress, Malinche or ``<bop>Do*a Marina<eop>'', who held substantial political authority for a woman of her background.
False	In another version, this transformation happens after the erroneous hymns are rectified and the son is called Ila. According to a variant, Shraddha wished for a daughter; Vashistha heeded her wish while performing the sacrifice and thus, a daughter was born. However, Manu desired a son so Vashistha appealed to <bop>Vishnu<eop> to change the gender of <bop>his<eop> daughter.
True	The Arnold version was the first of three songs through the mid 1950s to spend 21 weeks at No. 1. In 1950, Hank Snow's ``I'm Movin' On'' would match the record, and in 1955, their record would become jointly held by <bop>Webb Pierce<eop> with <bop>his<eop> cover of Jimmie Rodgers' ``In the Jailhouse Now.''

In <bop>her<eop> final episode of As Told By Ginger, Season 2's ``No Hope For Courtney'', <bop>Freeman<eop>'s character, Mrs. Gordon, retires from her teaching job though two of her students try convincing her to return to work.
False	It was released in movie theaters worldwide in wide release in 13 languages by Columbia Pictures, and was directed by Ken Annakin, a Disney legend and Lifetime Achievement Award recipient and Director of over 50 films. The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking was released worldwide on DVD in 2000 and re-released as a double feature with the movie Matilda starring Danny DeVito and <bop>Rhea Perlman<eop> in 2007. After <bop>her<eop> father's ship 'Hoptoad' is carried off by a sudden storm, the spunky Pippi Longstocking ( Tami Erin) is stranded with her horse, Alfonso, and her pet monkey, Mr. Nilsson, and takes up residence in the old family home, Villa Villekulla, which is thought by neighborhood children to be haunted.
False	It was in this period at his studio in Kinver, that he recorded songs with Clifford T. Ward, immediately before Clifford was signed to the Dandelion label of which John Peel was a co-owner (Get Your Kicks on the A456 by John Combe, p. 187). He has recorded songs by Dave Cartwright and also <bop>John Richards<eop> with whom <bop>he<eop> co-wrote ``Did You Like The Battle Sir?''.
True	Morey majored in drama and media studies, while undertaking a Bachelor of Arts Degree at Deakin University. She also completed a foundation course at the Victorian College of the Arts. Morey played the role of Lucy Green in the Nine Network children's television series, Pig's Breakfast, for two years. In 2000, <bop>she<eop> was accepted into National Institute of Dramatic Art. In 2007, <bop>Morey<eop> played Gina Quinn in an episode of All Saints.
False	Grace Mugabe is under personal sanctions in the European Union and the United States for her role in the Mugabe regime. Grace Mugabe was designated as head of the ZANU-PF Women's wing in 2014. In late 2014, Grace Mugabe was fiercely critical of Vice-President <bop>Joice Mujuru<eop>, who allegedly plotted against <bop>her<eop> husband President Mugabe.
True	It is alleged that Grace hit the women and her sons, with an extension cord, causing various injuries including a deep gash on Engels' forehead. This was after accusing the women of living with her sons. After charges were laid by Engels for ``assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm'', <bop>Grace<eop> was due to appear at a Johannesburg court on 15 August 2017, but failed to appear; <bop>she<eop> was subsequently granted diplomatic immunity.
False	Her parents were the playwright, Privy Councilor (``Geheimrat'') and archivist Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter and Louise Gotter (n*e Stiege). Her mother was a close friend of Caroline Schlegel (n*e Michaelis), while her father had been close friends with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe since his youth. Pauline Gotter had two sisters and knew Goethe and <bop>Caroline Schlegel<eop> from childhood on. In <bop>her<eop> youth she was friends with Sylvie von Ziegesar and the painter Louise Seidler.
True	Not long afterward, she was chosen to be president of the Lucy Stone League, a group based on Lucy Stone's decision to keep her maiden name after marriage. The group also chose Rose Falls Bres to serve as their legal counsel. Mrs. Bres, soon to be named president of the National Association of Women Lawyers, had been <bop>Hale<eop>'s lawyer during <bop>her<eop> battle with the State Department.
False	The gens is best known from a single individual, Gaius Matius, surnamed Calvena, a learned eques, who was an intimate friend of both Caesar and Cicero. Gaius Matius Calvena, the friend of Caesar and Cicero, subsequently befriended <bop>Octavian<eop>, but never exploited <bop>his<eop> relationship for personal gain.
False	In 1808, Tucker crafted another piece of proposed legislation that would have greatly reduced the number of mandatory appeals a party was entitled to, both in an effort to reduce the Court of Appeals's caseload and to curtail what Tucker saw as pointless delay tactics by parties that only served to clog the court system. The Virginia Assembly rejected this proposal, along with Tucker's idea of splitting the Court of Appeals into legal and chancery divisions. During <bop>his<eop> tenure, Tucker ruled in the notable case of Hudgins v. <bop>Wright<eop> (1806), a freedom suit in which his former mentor George Wythe had decided in favor of freedom for the slave Jackey Wright and her two children.
True	Murray Forsyth is a British political scientist. He was educated at Wellington College. He is Emeritus Professor of Politics at the University of Leicester. Alexander Warleigh argues that <bop>Forsyth<eop>'s account of the European Union as a confederation in <bop>his<eop> book Unions of States is the best way to understand the EU.
True	Although the king was alleged to have called out repeatedly for Diane, she was never summoned or admitted, and on his death, she was also not invited to the funeral. Immediately thereafter, Catherine de' Medici banished <bop>Diane<eop> from Chenonceau to the Ch*teau de Chaumont. <bop>She<eop> stayed there only a short time, and lived out her remaining years in her chateau in Anet, Eure-et-Loir, where she lived in comfortable obscurity.
False	However, after recording ``Any Old Time'' she left the band due to hostility from audiences in the South, as well as from music company executives who wanted a more ``mainstream'' singer. His band became enormously successful, and his playing was eventually recognized as equal to that of Benny Goodman: longtime Duke Ellington clarinetist Barney Bigard cited <bop>Shaw<eop> as <bop>his<eop> favorite clarinet player.
True	Fernando Valenzuela was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on August 23, 2003, in a pregame on the field ceremony at Dodger Stadium. In 2005, he was named one of three starting pitchers on Major League Baseball's Latino Legends Team. Dodgers clubhouse manager Mitch Poole has unofficially kept <bop>Valenzuela<eop>'s jersey number 34 out of circulation out of respect for <bop>him<eop>.
True	Her father, Henry R. Schoolcraft was an actor who appeared in shows in Mobile, Alabama and at Crisp's Gaiety Theater in New Orleans and who despite his death in 1854, saw to it that his son Luke Schoolcraft and his daughters Jane and <bop>Alfreda<eop> all pursued careers in theater. <bop>She<eop> and Jane performed sketches as a pair in local variety theater.
False	According to family tradition, as Pennington traveled in the Northwest Territory in the late 1790s Pennington met Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, and Thomas Worthington, a fellow Virginian who became governor of Ohio. Pennington's contact with these men, along with the success of the anti-slavery movement in Ohio, reportedly influenced his decision to become an anti-slavery activist. On one of <bop>his<eop> trips to Vincennes, the territorial capital, Pennington encountered <bop>William Henry Harrison<eop>, who became the pro-slavery governor of the Indiana Territory in 1801.
False	Aziza Mustafa Zadeh (Azeri: *ziz* Mustafazad*; born December 19, 1969) also known as <bop>The Princess<eop> of Jazz, or Die Prinzessin des Jazz or as Jazziza is an Azerbaijani singer, pianist and composer who plays a fusion of jazz and mugam (a traditional improvisational style of Azerbaijan) with classical and Avant-garde influences.

From 1982 until 1987, <bop>he<eop> was the Head of Department of Sociology in the Faculty of Social Sciences at Makerere University, Uganda's oldest university, which was founded in 1922.
False	Despite the subsequent escalation of the conflict, when Medusa learns that the X-Men only attacked now because the Terrigenesis cloud was about to reach the point where it would make the whole planet toxic to mutants, she resolves the situation by destroying the cloud, preventing any further Inhumans from manifesting their powers, feeling that the future of her species is not worth the present loss of mutant life that would result. In the aftermath, she along with <bop>her<eop> sister, Crystal, Black Bolt, Flint, Gorgon and Swain, are guided by Noh-Varr to the former Kree throne-world of <bop>Hala<eop> where he has stated they may discover the origins of Terrigen and in so doing offer a future to their doomed people, however, things are not well for the former Queen as she runs her hand through her powerful hair only to pull a large clump out with it, forcing her to announce to her crew that she is dying.
False	Music writer Ben Sisario described this stance as ``vintage college-rock 'tude--the hit, the pop song, should be avoided as inauthentic, while the aggro, anticommercial song represents legitimacy.'' Ivo Watts-Russell stated if <bop>Black Francis<eop> had been possibly persuaded to release the version of the song recorded during the session for the ``Gigantic'' single--which <bop>he<eop> described as ``totally streamlined and ready for radio''--that ``maybe if a major label company was able to convince people to take a more commercial route, maybe Pixies would have sold a whole bunch more records than they did.

False	During the siege of Yorktown the corps was at its maximum, the morning reports of April 30 showing an aggregate of 39,710, with 64 pieces of light artillery, and 34,633 reported as ``present for duty''. But this aggregate was maintained only briefly, as Porter's Division was taken away soon after to form part of the newly organized V Corps. Hamilton was relieved on April 30, and General <bop>Philip Kearny<eop> took <bop>his<eop> place, Hamilton assuming a division command in the Army of the Mississippi.
True	On August 26, 1831, Biddle's brother, Thomas, a War of 1812 veteran, was killed in a duel on Bloody Island (Mississippi River) at St. Louis, Missouri with Congressman Spencer Pettis.

False	Sophie was born in D*sseldorf as the only daughter of Prince William of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and his wife Princess Gerta of Ysenburg and B*dingen in W*chtersbach. She was a great great granddaughter of Charles Augustus, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, as well as a great granddaughter of William I of W*rttemberg. On <bop>her<eop> mother's side, Sophie was a great granddaughter of Frederick William, Elector of Hesse's morganatic marriage to <bop>Gertrude Falkenstein<eop>, Princess of Hanau.

False	Judges rarely second-guess the prosecutors' judgment on such a matter (and George stated that he was ``loath'' to do so). However, George's review of the evidence in the case caused him to feel so strongly that the prosecutors were in error that he did exactly that. George reassigned the case to the California Attorney General 's office, and that office successfully convicted <bop>Buono<eop> on nine of the 10 counts. Thus, it was recognized that the judge, through <bop>his<eop> action to deny the earlier motion to dismiss, had ultimately prevented a serial killer from going free.

True	``A key album in the shift in Pat Martino's sound at the end of the 60s -- with one foot in the soul jazz camp in which he got his start, and the other in the freer, open-minded style he used a lot in the 70s!'' Jazz critic Scott Yanow described the album as ``funky in spots, electric, and swinging when called for'' and extols <bop>Martino<eop>'s performance as ``consistently inventive`` ``Even this difficult instrument doesn't dampen <bop>his<eop> proficiency.''
False	I*igo Zabala, chairman of Warner Music Latin America commented that ``He's an artist that fits perfectly with our company,'' and that ``We are a label that has a major catalog of songwriters and quality pop and rock from the likes of Man*, Alejandro Sanz, Laura Pausini, and now, <bop>Arjona<eop>.''

True	The tactic worked well, and for the start of the 1954--55 the first-team began to use the tactic, with Don Revie as the deep-lying forward. As a result the tactic became known as the Revie Plan. On occasions when Revie was unavailable <bop>Williamson<eop> played the role, but made only nine appearances, and was transferred to Blackburn at the end of the season. <bop>He<eop> did not make much of an impact at Blackburn, making only nine appearances, in which he scored three goals.

False	``Sheriff Tom Allman said the device will aid in searches for missing persons, most often hunters and mushroom pickers, which cost the county tens of thousands of dollars. Allman recalled the 2011 search for <bop>Aaron Bassler<eop>, who had been accused of murdering two men in Fort Bragg and led law enforcement officers on an intense manhunt in the Noyo Basin, saying the LRAD might have made that search a little easier. <bop>He<eop> said it could also be used to warn residents in case of a tsunami.
False	On 22 or 23 July the French army laid siege to the city of Saintes. Henry realised that Hugh did not have as much support as he may have earlier claimed and withdrew to Bordeaux.

True	In Swash's opinion, Mickey had only been used for ``light relief'' since September 2005, when Swash was forced to take a three month break from the serial after he contracted meningoencephalitis -- a rare form of viral meningitis, which makes the brain swell up. EastEnders writers were reported to be ``frantically reworking scripts'' to explain Mickey's sudden disappearance, and according to Swash, this meant that a big storyline concentrating on the relationship between <bop>Mickey<eop> and <bop>his<eop> estranged father Mike had to be cut.

False	Veteran number 8 Imanol Harinordoquy responded publicly, attacking Li*vremont for taking his criticism public instead of keeping it within the team.

False	Asylum records show that in the early history of the Magdalene movement many women entered and left the institutions of their own accord, sometimes repeatedly. Lu Ann De Cunzo wrote in <bop>her<eop> book, Reform, Respite, Ritual: An Archaeology of Institutions; The Magdalene Society of Philadelphia, 1800--1850, that the women in Philadelphia's asylum ``sought a refuge and a respite from disease, the prison or almshouse, unhappy family situations, abusive men, and dire economic circumstances.''

True	Coming out of C. D. Hylton High School in Woodbridge, Virginia, Butler was offered scholarships to several smaller schools, but decided to follow his mother's advice of ``shooting for the moon'', and enrolled at Penn State without an athletic scholarship as a defensive back.

False	In the first decade of the 21st century attempts to rescue Scott's reputation were led by polar explorer and adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, with his 2003 biography Captain Scott. The book has been noted not only for its defence of Scott but for the stridency of its attacks on <bop>Huntford<eop>, which Fiennes claimed would have gone considerably further, had the laws of libel allowed. Fiennes, who has apparently studied how the great explorers of <bop>his<eop> own generation came to be sidelined, later described Scott as ``a great historic hero whose name has been dragged through the dirt.''
False	Barrett returned onscreen in November at the pre-show of Survivor Series. On the 29 December 2014 episode of Raw, Barrett returned to action and defeated Cesaro.

True	A popular hypothesis is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time. The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like Cailleach figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. Margaret Murray proposed this, as did <bop>Anne Ross<eop>, who wrote in <bop>her<eop> essay, ``The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts'', ``I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect...''

The Pirates celebrated <bop>his<eop> nomination at PNC Park with an 8--5 victory over the visiting Philadelphia Phillies, a game where Meek was the winning pitcher.

In the book Fiendebilde Wollweber (Enemy picture Wollweber) by Norwegian historian Lars Borgersrud, Strand Johansen is portrayed as a vitriolic opponent of the Furubotn faction. The conflict climaxed on October 26, 1949 when Strand Johansen together with five or more people showed up in the party offices in Klingenberggata 4 and kicked out <bop>Furubotn<eop>'s supporters. The purge began six days prior when <bop>he<eop> had initiated the move against Furubotn at a meeting of trustees of the Oslo party, levelling against the supporters of Peder Furubotn fierce accusations of factionalism and of having set up an illegitimate party leadership -- ``the second center''.

True	In Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Lucy is played by Sadie Frost.

True	This change in language was provided in the 1957 Act; the old language was considered anachronistic, as since the 1870s Britain had employed the ``long-drop'' method of hanging, which was held to cause near-instantaneous death.

When specifically asked whether <bop>he<eop> had supplied the voice, possibly from a previous recording, Jones told Newsday: ``You'd have to ask <bop>Lucas<eop> about that.
True	When Trapper and Hawkeye get back to the 4077th, they have Borelli paged to the OR and the two surgeons scrub in. Radar comes into the OR, looking upset and urges Hawkeye to go to the Swamp, where <bop>Borelli<eop> waits. In the Swamp Borelli sits with a scared, somber expression on <bop>his<eop> face, and Hawkeye realizes that the surgeon is drunk and unfit to operate.
False	He moved to Adrian, Michigan in October 1836. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate from the 2nd district, 1839 to 1840 and later from the 3rd district, 1842 to 1843. Greenly served as the fifth Lieutenant Governor from 1846 to 1847 and became Governor on March 4, 1847 after the resignation of <bop>Alpheus Felch<eop> to take a seat in the U.S. Senate. <bop>He<eop> completed Felch's term through January 3, 1848.
False	Hungarian sources from 1288 make notice of one Russian named Ivan (Iwan dicto Oroz) as an ally of the ban of Severin, Theodore Vejtehi from the kindred Csan*d, who was one of the nobles that opposed the rule of Charles I of Hungary in 1316--1317. The land to the south of Severin was governed for Bulgaria by the despot of Vidin, Michael Shishman, a supporter of Vejtehi. Thus, as the Hungarian king established <bop>his<eop> authority over Severin and suppressed <bop>Vejtehi<eop>'s rebellion, Ivan the Russian may have fled to Vidin and entered the service of Michael Shishman.
True	Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks her to come back to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she will not come back because she does not feel she will be forgiven. Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and Susan, who comfort <bop>Katherine<eop> and say they will try to forgive <bop>her<eop>.
False	DeAnn Welker of MSNBC complimented the Katherine homecoming, and said the best line of the episode was Karen McCluskey's response when Katherine rejected visitors: ``Who says I'm visiting? Maybe I'm bonkers too.'' Welker, however, was critical of the subplot between Gaby and <bop>Susan<eop>, who <bop>she<eop> said were ``stuck in storylines-that-don't-matter territory.''
False	This service recounts the Harrowing of Hell, at which time, according to Orthodox theology, the righteous dead were raised from Hades and entered into Paradise. This Good News of Christ's triumph over death, the Church teaches, was at that time revealed only to the departed. The revelation to the living occurred when <bop>his<eop> tomb was found empty ``very early in the morning, on the first day of the week'' (<bop>Mark<eop> 16:2) and this vigil recounts that discovery of the empty tomb.
False	Lancelot, at the end of his own life, will be buried next to Galehaut in the magnificent tomb that the younger man had built to consecrate and eternalize their companionship. Since the early thirteenth century, there have been numerous retellings, in various languages, of the life and loves and chivalric career of Lancelot. The story of <bop>his<eop> adulterous liaison with Guinevere has always been part of every significant account of <bop>King Arthur<eop>.
True	He was the second son of King John of Saxony (1801--1873) and his wife Princess Amelia of Bavaria (1801--1877), daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria (1756--1825). On 11 May 1859 at Bel*m Palace, Lisbon, George married the younger sister of King Pedro V of Portugal: The Infanta Maria Anna of Portugal, eldest surviving daughter of Queen <bop>Maria II<eop> of Portugal and <bop>her<eop> consort Prince Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koh*ry.
False	And since the Emperor took an oath (Book III) when he becomes Sultan to spread the faith of Islam by conquest, the threat of persecution or martyrdom for Christians was real. Henry VIII was directly responsible for <bop>Thomas More<eop>'s tribulation when <bop>he<eop> wrote the Dialogue in the tower.
True	When he learns about his daughter's career with the Arrow, he attempts to convince her to join forces with him, but he is ultimately arrested by Donna's current romantic interest, police captain Quentin Lance, when <bop>Felicity<eop> decides that no matter what he claims he will never be anything more than a criminal that <bop>she<eop> can never trust.
False	He is hunted down by Danny Brickwell and Michael Amar because he is the only one who can disable the nukes that Darhk has launched, forcing Team Arrow to rescue him and recruit his assistance in disabling the nuclear missiles, although his best efforts are only able to stop the missiles after one missile is launched and redirect that missile to a relatively small town. Before teaming up with <bop>her<eop> father to stop the missiles, Donna revealed to <bop>Felicity<eop> that Noah didn't abandon them; rather, Donna and Felicity left Noah after Donna discovered his life of crime, not wanting their daughter to be corrupted.
True	He was also included in the 40-strong preliminary England World Cup squad for the 1982 finals; however, he was not picked in the final 22. His promising Villa career was effectively ended after sustaining a knee injury in an away game at Nottingham Forest. After a heavy tackle, he was helped to his feet by Ian Bowyer and, in <bop>Shaw<eop>'s words, something in <bop>his<eop> knee 'clicked'.
False	Returning to the Oc*anic for the 2004--05 season, Crosby continued dominating the league, leading the league with 66 goals, 102 assists and 168 points over 62 games to capture his second consecutive Beliveau Trophy. Joining Crosby on Rimouski's top line were wingers Dany Roussin and Marc-Antoine Pouliot, who finished second and third in league-scoring with 116 and 114 points, respectively. In addition to <bop>his<eop> scoring title, Crosby was once again named <bop>Most Valuable Player<eop>, Offensive Player and Personality of the Year honours, while repeating as a QMJHL First All-Star.
False	Petersburg in 1842, Semyon Gulak-Artemovsky became a soloist of the Imperial Opera at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, a position he held for 22 years. In 1852 and 1853 he sang roles in Anton Rubinstein's first two operas, Dmitry Donskoy and Fomka the Fool. Gulak-Artemovsky performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow from 1864 to 1865. He performed over fifty operatic roles during <bop>his<eop> career, including Ruslan in <bop>Glinka<eop>'s Ruslan and Lyudmila, Masetto in Mozart's Don Giovanni, as well as Antonio and Lord Ashton in Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix and Lucia di Lammermoor.
True	In 1997 the two reunited after Kristen's lies were revealed and John asked Marlena to marry him. However, the wedding was interrupted when Kristen came in with Marlena's ex-husband Roman, who was believed to be dead. Roman returned to Salem and Kristen had told him that he and <bop>Marlena<eop> were still married and John and <bop>her<eop> were a couple.
False	At Belle's christening, Roman found out about John and Marlena's affair, and was furious. Marlena found out that Sami had switched Belle's paternity test, and John was actually Belle's father. Marlena moved out with Belle, and she and Roman divorced. John provided Marlena and <bop>Belle<eop> a place to stay while <bop>she<eop> was working out the divorce.
True	Hay-Webster admitted that she previously had dealings with Bennett's followers, and expressed confidence that she could win back their support, but denied that she had any dealings with Bennett himself. However, in later years she crossed party lines to work with fellow woman politician and neighbouring South East St. Catherine MP Olivia Grange, successfully reducing gang violence. In <bop>her<eop> re-election campaign for the 2007 elections, <bop>Hay-Webster<eop> faced off against Devon McDaniel, a JLP member who had formerly represented the South Trelawny constituency but withdrew from politics in 2005, only to announce in February 2007 that he would stand against Hay-Webster for the St. Catherine seat instead.
False	Michael Farr, author of Tintin: The Complete Companion, notes: ``Whereas Herg* kept Tintin's facial expressions to a bare minimum ... Haddock's could be contorted with emotion.'' Farr goes on to write that ``In <bop>Haddock<eop>, Herg* had come up with <bop>his<eop> most inspired character since creating Tintin'' and sales of the volume in which Haddock was introduced indicated the character was well received.
False	This was erected 195 years after Shahul's era. As a mark of respect people also Venerate the sandals of the saint which are preserved in the shrine. The central part of the dargah is the tomb of the saint, Shahul Hamid, who is a direct descendant of Mohammed, through <bop>his<eop> grandson Hassan, through <bop>Abdel Khader Gilani<eop>, Sultanul Awliya, and approached through seven thresholds (four made of silver and three of gold).
True	Angerer was Germany's second choice goalkeeper behind Silke Rottenberg for almost a decade, winning six major titles as a reserve player without having played in a single game, including the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, two Olympic bronze medals in 2000, 2004, and three UEFA European Championships in 1997, 2001 and 2005. When Rottenberg suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury, <bop>Angerer<eop> was picked as the starting goalkeeper for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup. During the entire tournament <bop>she<eop> did not concede a single goal, setting the record for most consecutive minutes played without conceding a goal in World Cup play to 540 minutes.
True	In summer 1925 Mayakovsky visited New York, where he met Russian *migr* Elli Jones (born Yelizaveta Petrovna Zibert), an interpreter who spoke Russian, French, German and English fluently. They fell in love, for three months were inseparable, but decided to keep their affair secret. Soon after the poet's return to the Soviet Union, Elli gave birth to <bop>Patricia<eop>. Mayakovsky saw <bop>her<eop> just once, in Nice, France, in 1928, when she was three.
True	Watson also reveals stories about the hotel's past: an earlier caretaker, Delbert Grady, killed his wife and two daughters, and then himself. A guest, Mrs Massey, committed suicide in a bathtub after her young lover abandoned her. In parallel, outside the hotel, Hallorann informs Danny of <bop>his<eop> sense that Danny possesses a second sight, the ``shining'', which <bop>Hallorann<eop>'s grandmother detected in him as a child.
False	She is the first and only colored student to attend, and therefore is often assumed to be attending on scholarship, but in reality comes from a rich family. Millicent is an orphan who came to Buffalo from Ohio to live with her Aunt and Uncle, who had adopted her. She is mature for her age and is the first to tell Louisa that <bop>Grace<eop> is acting suicidal. <bop>She<eop> volunteers at the Fitch Creche, set up by Maria Love as the first daycare center in Buffalo, and is asked to escort Grace home by Mrs.
True	She is the one who was responsible for organizing the breakfast carts, a charity act that offered a free breakfast to any child the opportunity to grab something to eat on the way to school. Maria Love and Ansley Wilcox, Christian charity reformers, were strongly against giving aide to just anyone without evaluating them to see if they deserved it. Since Margaret funded these carts out of <bop>her<eop> own pocket, Maria Love refused to keep them going after <bop>Margaret<eop>'s death.
True	She was appointed to the Court on 9 April 2010 replacing Justice David Angel who retired in January 2010. Justice Blokland is the third female appointment to the Court since it was established in 1911. At the time of her appointment, the Court for the first time had two females Judges, with Justice Judith Kelly being appointed in August 2009. At the time of <bop>her<eop> appointment Justice <bop>Blokland<eop> was the Chief Magistrate of the Northern Territory having been appointed firstly as a Magistrate in 2002 and then Chief Magistrate in 2006.
False	The plot, setting, and costumes are nearly identical to those of the Stanley Kubrick 1960 version; however, this adaptation follows Howard Fast's novel more closely than does <bop>Kubrick<eop>'s film. (Two of the more noticeable omissions from the new adaptation are the ``I am Spartacus!'' scene and Spartacus' and <bop>his<eop> wife's reunion after the battle.)
True	With time the name of the island, San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico, traded places with what is now the capital of Puerto Rico: John the Baptist. According to Floyd, ``<bop>Ponce<eop> built the only stone house in the village, which for years functioned additionally as the Casa de Contratacion, the archive, and the arsenal.'' It became <bop>his<eop> permanent home, where he was joined by his family in 1509.

False	Marx did not study directly with Hegel, but after Hegel died Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, Bruno Bauer, a leader of the circle of Young Hegelians to whom Marx attached himself. However, Marx and Engels came to disagree with Bruno Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic. Having achieved <bop>his<eop> thesis on the Difference of natural philosophy between Democritus and Epicurus in 1841, the young Marx progressively broke away with the Prussian university and its teachings impregnated by German Idealism (Kant, Fichte, Schelling and <bop>Hegel<eop>).

False	In February 2006, MTV reported that Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin had signed a new management deal with Azoff Management, with a spokesperson confirming they had signed under The Smashing Pumpkins moniker. In response, Auf der Maur said in a separate interview that ``as long as Billy has <bop>Jimmy<eop>, <bop>he<eop> can make the essential Pumpkins record, I'm sure'' and when asked of her involvement said she was not planning on participating in the reunion but noted that her ``services are always there to play (her) favorite songs.

False	Levavasseur was born in Le Mesnil-au-Val, Cherbourg, France to a naval officer. Initially studying fine arts, Levavasseur switched to studying engineering, with a particular interest in arc lamp s and petrol engine s. In the summer of 1902, Levavasseur suggested to industrialist <bop>Jules Gastambide<eop> that powerful, lightweight engines would be necessary for powered flight, and proposed the manufacture of these engines. <bop>He<eop> also proposed that the engines be named after Gastambide's daughter, Antoinette.
False	In the book he re-tells numerous tales of his amusing escapades with Flynn during the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood and of the movies they made together, including how the famous Arrow Splitting scene was filmed in The Adventures of Robin Hood. Wiles documents numerous escapades with Flynn and it is interesting to note that whilst Buster managed a whole book on Errol, Flynn didn't manage a line on <bop>Buster<eop> in <bop>his<eop> own infamous autobiography My Wicked, Wicked Ways.
False	Many more methods exist and reported by the research groups of Magnus, Overman, Kuehne, Rawal, Bosch, Vollhardt, Mori, Shibasaki, Li, Fukuyama Vanderwal and MacMillan. Synthetic (+)-strychnine is also known. Racemic synthesises were published by Padwa in 2007 and in 2010 by Andrade and by Reissig. In <bop>his<eop> 1963 publication Woodward quoted Sir <bop>Robert Robinson<eop> who said for its molecular size it is the most complex substance known.
False	At the Larsen home, Stan (Brent Sexton) listens at Terry's bedroom door. He then leaves Mitch a voice mail saying he and the boys miss her. In her motel room, Mitch ignores Stan's call.

False	In April 1536 he joined the league of Schmalkalden, though he did not assent to some of the schemes of Philip of Hesse for attacking Charles V. In 1546 his troops fought against the emperor during the war of the league of Schmalkalden, but with disastrous results for W*rttemberg. The duchy was quickly overrun, and the duke compelled to agree to the treaty of Heilbronn in January 1547. By this treaty Charles, ignoring the desire of Ferdinand to depose <bop>Ulrich<eop> again, allowed <bop>him<eop> to retain his duchy, but stipulated that he should pay a large sum of money, surrender certain fortresses, and appear as a suppliant before the emperor at Ulm.
False	His wife, Margaret Bryan was governess to the King's four acknowledged children, Mary, <bop>Elizabeth<eop>, Edward and his illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset. <bop>She<eop> impressed the King so much that he made her Baroness Bryan in her own right.
True	Lindsey thinks she has got her point across to Karla, until she realises a distressed Emily saw the whole incident. Emily begins to pick up on Lindsey's violent and aggressive behavior. On trying to keep her away from the girls she's fighting with, <bop>she<eop> ends up getting caught in the middle of a confrontation between Lindsey and Michaela, a confrontation which is broken up just in time by Rachel and Christopher Mead In Episode six, <bop>Emily<eop> is seen developing a crush on her friend Denzil Kelly, not at all approved by Lindsey.
True	Soon after the congressional visit, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld paid an official visit to Montenegro, seeking support for the War on Terror and overall American geopolitical goals in Europe. Following the Secretary's meeting with Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo *ukanovi*, it was announced that Montenegro had agreed in principle to aid the US efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, although no specific pledges of aid were made. For <bop>his<eop> part, <bop>Secretary Rumsfeld<eop> stated that the United States supported Montenegro's desire to join NATO and would also assist in its acquiring membership in the Partnership for Peace programme.
False	Georgiades tried to break his way into the team but the imposing figure of *ukasz Sosin, the championship's top scorer for three straight years, was blocking him. At the end of the season Apollon hired Sinisa Gogic as the manager and without even seeing <bop>Georgiades<eop> play, <bop>he<eop> told him to find a new club.
False	They became friends, and had lengthy philosophical conversations. Rand's discussions with Hospers contributed to her decision to write nonfiction. Hospers read Atlas Shrugged (1957), which he considered an aesthetic triumph. Although Hospers became convinced of the validity of <bop>Rand<eop>'s moral and political views, <bop>he<eop> disagreed with her about issues of epistemology, the subject of their extensive correspondence.
False	In 2011, Jonas Gahr St*re, the then Foreign Minister of Norway which is an EFTA member state, said that EFTA/EEA membership for the microstates was not the appropriate mechanism for their integration into the internal market due to their different requirements than large countries such as Norway, and suggested that a simplified association would be better suited for them. Espen Barth Eide, <bop>St*re<eop>'s successor, responded to the Commission's report in late 2012 by questioning whether the microstates have sufficient administrative capabilities to meet the obligations of EEA membership. However, <bop>he<eop> stated that Norway was open to the possibility of EFTA membership for the microstates if they decide to submit an application, and that the country had not made a final decision on the matter.
True	When Ferguson joined up with Henry Ford to allow his 'Ferguson System' three-point linkage to be used on the Fordson N tractors, the agreement was terminated prematurely by Ferguson's own actions.

The win meant that <bop>he<eop> had now won the Commonwealth title as an amateur and as a professional.
True	Through those years, he had to remain reclusive to avoid the attention of the loansharks that he became indebted to in a huge way over the years. The FBI stated that he owed $450,000 to many individuals including mobsters in other crime families. Vincent Palermo became enraged at <bop>Masella<eop> and thought of <bop>him<eop> as an embarrassment.
False	Chamberlain later commented that he could see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court ``comical'', and when 6*ft 11*in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of <bop>his<eop> career, Lanier answered: ``When <bop>Wilt Chamberlain<eop> lifted me up and moved me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position.''
False	With a generous salary added to the sizable inheritance he received from his opium-trader grandfather, and the respectability of a high government appointment, the family was ensconced in the higher echelons of elite, westernized society, as compradors of the British Raj.

True	One can't judge his accomplishments by his list of wins because World War II interrupted his career just as World War I interrupted that of Philippe Thys. Coppi won it all: the world hour record, the world championships, the grands tours, classics as well as time trials. The great French cycling journalist, Pierre Chany says that between 1946 and 1954, once <bop>Coppi<eop> had broken away from the peloton, the peloton never saw <bop>him<eop> again.
True	After his senior season, he was named a High School All-America n at free safety. He played in the 2002 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.

True	Nikolay Ivanovich Gnedich ( ) (February 2(13), 1784, Poltava - February 3(15), 1833, Saint Petersburg) was a Russia n poet and translator best known for his idyll The Fishers (1822). His translation of the Iliad (1807-29) is still the standard one. Alexander Pushkin assessed <bop>Gnedich<eop>'s Iliad as ``a noble exploit worthy of Achilles'' and addressed to <bop>him<eop> an epistle starting with lines ``With Homer you conversed alone for days and nights...'' http://oldpoetry.com/poetry/3037/showline=1 Pushkin also penned an epigram in Homeric hexameter s, which unfavourably compares one-eyed Gnedich with the blind Greek poet:

LeBron James and Kyrie Irving would each score 41 points in Game 5 to give the Cavaliers a 112--97 win in Game 5 and keep them alive in the NBA Finals. LeBron James would keep <bop>his<eop> dominance going through Game 6 with a 41-point performance to give the Cavaliers a 115--101 win over the Warriors. in Game 7, with 1:50 remaining in the game, LeBron James blocked <bop>Andre Iguodala<eop>'s potential go-ahead layup to keep the game tied at 89--89 and then Kyrie Irving hit a three-pointer with less than a minute remaining to put the Cavaliers ahead 92--89.
True	Bentley, while suffering severe debilitation, was not insane. The jury took 75 minutes to decide that both Craig and Bentley were guilty of PC Miles's murder. Bentley was sentenced to death with a plea for mercy on 11 December 1952, while <bop>Craig<eop> was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure (<bop>he<eop> was eventually released in May 1963 after serving 10 years' imprisonment and has been a law abiding citizen ever since).

True	Willis was soon in conflict with the legal profession and various leading citizens in Melbourne, and a series of petitions were produced calling for him to be recalled to Sydney; Gipps recalled him on 17 June 1843.

However, in December 1844, after Willis appealed the order removing <bop>him<eop> from office to the Privy Council, Jeffcott resigned, out of conscientious concern that were <bop>Willis<eop>' appeal upheld his own appointment would be invalid.
False	Particularly admired for her portrayal of Wagner and Strauss heroines, she notably sang Br*nnhilde under Marek Janowski on the 1982 recording of The Ring Cycle which won a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.

False	The first, in 1895 is a memoir of her childhood, written under obedience to the Prioress, Mother Agnes of Jesus, her older sister Pauline. Mother Agnes gave the order after being prompted by their eldest sister, <bop>Sister Marie<eop> of the Sacred Heart.

True	Australia replied with 491 when they batted; Verity took four for 78 in 53*overs and was able to prevent the batsmen scoring quickly. The match was eventually drawn. Cardus, in criticising the English bowlers in the game, wrote: ``<bop>Verity<eop> is apparently the only England bowler in existence at the present time--and <bop>he<eop> is not subtle on a hard wicket.''
False	Bourke described him as ``a fair, rather good-looking, slim man'' who was shabbily dressed in ``an undress general's uniform with a large sword clanking by his side'' and thin old button boots ``which were rather trying to his poor feet on the rocks.'' A few months later, after <bop>his<eop> capture, Kirkham was seen by the former Confederate General <bop>William Loring<eop>, who had taken service with the Egyptians, and described as ``utterly used up by disease and dissipation'', wearing an ancient and much-patched British military uniform, and being very indignant that his nationality and British passport were being ignored.

True	The years following Selfe's address saw more rapid advancements in mobile technologies, social media, and Web 2.0, creating even more new venues of composing for teachers to pay attention to.

False	However, Markbreit became confused by the similar design of both sides of the coin: one side had two helmets and the other side showed two players holding helmets. Thus, he incorrectly thought ``heads'' had landed. When Markbreit became confused, NBC Sports play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg ordered his producer to cut off the microphones surrounding midfield and pull away from the tight shot involving Markbreit, Kuechenburg and Redskins quarterback <bop>Joe Theismann<eop>. After a short discussion with <bop>his<eop> head linesman, Dale Hamer, Markbreit corrected his mistake before the kickoff.

True	Later, he appeared on General Hospital playing mobster and FBI informant Roy DiLucca from 1999 to 2002. 3 During his time with General Hospital, he was awarded three consecutive ALMA Awards from 2000 to 2002.

While Lennon was in Spain filming How I Won the War in September 1966, Harrison and <bop>Boyd<eop> flew to Bombay as guests of sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, and returned to London on 23*October 1966. Through <bop>her<eop> interest in Eastern mysticism and her membership in the Spiritual Regeneration Movement, she inspired all four Beatles to meet the Indian mystic Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London on 24*August 1967, which resulted in a visit to Bangor, Gwynedd, to join him again in the following day.
True	Influenced from the mid-nineties by the works of Imi Knoebel, Agnes Martin and Ad Reinhardt, <bop>Hannah Maybank<eop> uses both construction and destruction to create works which echo our relationship to time and the natural world.

Arianna Reiche from Gawker commented on the episode ``Game Changer'' where <bop>Gloria<eop> hides <bop>her<eop> skill at chess so her husband will not be upset at losing: ``This moment is at best a sappy quip about compromise in an often heavy-handed series, and at worst, it's a moment in a show with 9.3 million viewers, on a network owned by Disney, which explicitly validates girls and women subduing their intellect.''
False	Following her streak of well-received roles, Montenegro returned to television in 2008, taking a supporting role, as Dona Iraci, in the critically and publicly acclaimed primetime mini-Series ``Queridos Amigos'', based on the book ``Aos Amigos'', by Portuguese novelist Maria Adelaide Amaral, an ensemble piece that tells a fictional reconstitution of personal experiences of Amaral and a group of close friends, set during a moment of political turbulance in the Brazilian transition from a military dictatorship to a democratic regime. Throughout the decades, several successful roles emerged on television, as well as theatre, for which Montenegro earned a series of distinctions and accolades. Often cited for <bop>her<eop> wide acting range, as well as for the consistency in delivering top quality performances, Montenegro quickly emerged as a favorite amongst critics and audiences, eventually receiving the title of ``<bop>The First Lady<eop> of Brazilian Theatre''.
False	The program features various ``legends'' of the business, for their work in and out of the ring, having a roundtable discussion about specific topics, persons, or occurrences in the history of wrestling.

This enabled <bop>him<eop> to secure his authority in the city.

False	According to Mariana Enriquez from P*gina/12 newspaper, ``just a few write as well as <bop>Shakira<eop>'', and that the best example was ``No''.

True	The two finally have sex, and Daniela describes on her blog how she feels torn between Antonia and Tom*s, both of whom with which she is regularly having sex.

When she complains to Antonia, Antonia invites her to a party, where Daniela briefly performs oral sex on Tom*s until he stops her.

False	Following a Skrull invasion, Captain America (James ``Bucky'' Barnes) organizes a meeting with the New Avengers at his home, offering it as a base of operations. Cage is offered the role as leader of the New Avengers, but turns it down, giving the role to Ronin. Following the Siege of Asgard, Steve Rogers appoints <bop>Luke Cage<eop> leader of the Thunderbolts program. Soon after, <bop>he<eop> begins to recruit new Thunderbolts, a balanced mix of former and older members, personally inducting the Ghost, Moonstone, the Juggernaut and Crossbones, with MACH-V, Fixer and Songbird's cooperation, and using the Man-Thing's powers for long-distance transportation.

The character is introduced as a bar owner who Jones meets during the course of an investigation. He was formerly married to a woman named Reva Connors until Kilgrave controlled <bop>Jessica Jones<eop> into killing <bop>her<eop>.
False	Dystheists may themselves be theists or atheists, and in the case of either, concerning the nature of the God of Abrahamic faiths, will assert that God is not good, and is possibly, although not necessarily, malevolent, particularly (but not exclusively) to those who do not wish to follow that faith. For example, in <bop>his<eop> Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God (1741), Jonathan Edwards, a devout theist, describes a <bop>God<eop> full of vengeful rage and contempt, seemingly different from one with Christ-like omnibenevolence.

True	In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, music critic Lester Bangs called Hot August Night a ``fine presentation of the entire spectrum'' of Diamond's work and praised its music as ``great, pretentious, goofy pop'' with a melodramatic, ``hymn-like feeling''.

False	Avrigus is an Australian Gothic doom metal band consisting of two members, Simon Gruer and Megan Tassaker. The group has released two EPs and one full-length album to date.

False	Sima Shi, however, had a serious eye illness that was aggravated by the campaign, and he died less than a month later. At that time, Sima Zhao was with his brother at Xuchang (in modern Xuchang, Henan). The 14-year-old emperor Cao Mao made an effort to regain imperial power. <bop>He<eop> issued an edict which, under the rationale that Sima Shi had just defeated Guanqiu Jian and <bop>Wen Qin<eop>'s rebellion and that the southeastern empire was still not complete pacified, ordered Sima Zhao to remain at Xuchang and that Sima Shi's assistant Fu Jia return to Luoyang with the main troops.
False	During the next few years, he was involved in commanding forces in repelling invasions by Shu's commander of the armed forces, Jiang Wei. In 254, while Sima Zhao was at the capital Luoyang, advisors to the Wei emperor <bop>Cao Fang<eop> suggested that the emperor surprise Sima Zhao and kill <bop>him<eop> to seize his troops, and then use those troops against Sima Shi.

True	Stjepan also gained employment as an assistant to the director of the local community health center in order to provide an income for his wife and daughters.

False	Indeed, Bliss believes Coriolanus may have been the King's Men's debut play at the theatre. Taylor believes that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring 1608. In his 1994 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, R.B. Parker dates the play mid-1608. In <bop>his<eop> 2000 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Lee Bliss is unconvinced by the arguments that <bop>Shakespeare<eop> is referring to the freezing of the Thames or to Myddelton's scheme, and settles on a date of late 1608 to early 1609.
False	Hackenbush is saved by Stuffy and Tony, who pose as house detectives and then as paperhangers, who first paste the vamp to the wall behind layers of wallpaper and then hide her under the sofa cushions. Next, Whitmore brings in the eminent Dr. Steinberg (<bop>Sig Ruman<eop>) from Vienna, whom <bop>he<eop> hopes will expose Hackenbush as a quack.
True	Tony raises some money by scamming Hackenbush in the ``Tutsi Fruitsy Ice Cream'' scene, in which Tony gives Hackenbush a tip on a horse, but all in code, so that Hackenbush has to buy book after book from Tony to decipher the code. At the Sanitarium, Judy's business manager, Whitmore (Leonard Ceeley) -- who is also Morgan's stooge -- suspects Hackenbush is a fraud and attempts to expose him and rattle Mrs. <bop>Upjohn<eop>'s faith in him by having <bop>her<eop> discover him in a compromising situation with a blonde floozie (Esther Muir).

True	Piggy surprises everyone by being the only girl to join Chadwick and Shayne in the final jump. Though she initially struggles, she finally summons the bravery and makes the leap.

False	Chadwick has a heart-to-heart with Piggy and brings up the issues expressed by the other cast members, which upsets her. A night out at the club causes a humorous situation for Kefla as an old woman hits on him. Piggy begins to have issues with <bop>Christina<eop>, who <bop>she<eop> feels she bonded with initially yet now constantly disregards her.
False	As described in Smithsonian Magazine, ``In 1907 during spring training in Augusta, Georgia, a black groundskeeper named Bungy Cummings, whom Cobb had known for years, attempted to shake Cobb's hand or pat him on the shoulder.''

In 1978, <bop>she<eop> landed the role of Sue Ellen Ewing in the CBS series Dallas.
True	Animals often use two or more of these mechanisms together to produce the colours and effects they need. Animal coloration has been a topic of interest and research in biology for centuries. In the classical era, Aristotle recorded that the octopus was able to change its coloration to match its background, and when it was alarmed. In <bop>his<eop> 1665 book Micrographia, <bop>Robert Hooke<eop> describes the ``fantastical'' (structural, not pigment) colours of the Peacock's feathers:
False	Thus, diagnosis of the disease at an early stage leads to a favorable outcome not because of early treatment but because those patients tend to have a less-virulent form.

Under <bop>his<eop> direction, the program became recognized as one of the leading centers for training in clinical research methods.

False	Sandeep Singh of Verdens Gang wrote that Journals is ``neither a profound diary or a studio album it could have been (...) But this is undoubtedly the best Bieber has bubbled up to now.'' The Washington Post's Alison Stewart offered a negative outlook on the project, writing that ``Justin Bieber ends a bad year with a bad album.'' In <bop>his<eop> review written for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Piet Levy wrote that <bop>Bieber<eop> is ``less an eager child than a confident adult, although when Bieber's flat come-ons are juxtaposed with seasoned R&B star R. Kelly on ''PYD,`` it's clear that as a performer, he still has a lot of growing up to do.''
False	According to the producer, Bieber suggested they to ``flip those Craig David chords and (...) create something.'' By doing so, he came up with the song ``Recovery'', a song that was finished at Cherry Beach Sound in Toronto. As <bop>he<eop> recalled, the process had Bieber hearing <bop>Boyd<eop> songs and selected them to sing, and many songs from the producer turned into songs off Journals.

Thirty-five years later he tracked down Rodr*guiez, and interviewed and photographed <bop>her<eop>.
True	Even when Johnson is offstage or the writing sags with exposition, the show, directed solidly by Bill Rauch, retains the vitalizing imprint of his performance.'' Other characters such as Hoover and George Wallace are ``merely sketched in,'' and the play ``sorely needs streamlining.'' In <bop>his<eop> review of the American Repertory Theater production, also starring Cranston, <bop>Isherwood<eop> said the play ``ultimately accrues minimal dramatic momentum.''
False	Faora was due to be given orders, but Clark Kent interrupted the proceedings before Faora and the rest of the soldiers were ordered by Zod to ``Kneel before Kal-El''.

True	Kawada said that she was challenged in writing lyrics for the song, since her previous single ``Get My Way'' was different from her previous singles. Kawada would read the source material of every anime before writing lyrics for its theme songs. She named the song ``Joint'' because of Shana II's theme of characters Shana and Y*ji Sakai fighting together. In response to comments that the expressions in <bop>her<eop> voice were very varied, <bop>Kawada<eop> stated that she simply sings with the music in the way that she most enjoys.
False	That same year, Kawada and <bop>Shimamiya<eop> performed a number of theme songs for visual novels as the unit Healing Leaf, although only one of those songs, ``Ame ni Utau Ballad'' (*******, ``A Ballad Sung in the Rain''), was featured in an I've Sound Compilation.

True	Her father Charles was a brother of Queen Charlotte of the UK and her mother Frederike was a granddaughter of Louis VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. Her maternal grandmother, Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt, and her paternal first-cousin Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom served as sponsors at her baptism; her second given name came from Princess Augusta Sophia. At the time of <bop>her<eop> birth, <bop>Louise<eop>'s father was not yet the ruler of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (he would not succeed his brother as Duke until 1794), and consequently she was not born in a court, but rather in a less formal home.

True	Tales are changed in which Robin steals all that an ambushed traveler carried, such as ``Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford'', so that the victim keeps a third and another third is dedicated to the poor.

False	Pitchfork writer Jillian Mapes was more critical of the song, calling the song ``sedated'', ``wholly inoffensive'', and ``a shrug of a song'', while saying that ``(Malibu is) so breezy, it makes Sheryl Crow seem edgy, or Lady Gaga's <bop>Joanne<eop> resemble a legit rock'n'roll reinvention.''
