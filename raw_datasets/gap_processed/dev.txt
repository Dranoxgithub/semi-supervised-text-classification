Defeated by Governor <bop>Angeloz<eop> by over 15%, this latter setback was significant because it cost De la Sota much of <bop>his<eop> support within the Justicialist Party (which was flush with victory in the 1991 mid-terms), leading to President Carlos Menem 's endorsement of a separate party list in C*rdoba for the 1993 mid-term elections, and to De la Sota's failure to regain a seat in Congress.

False	Their poor receptions disillusioned Murnau, and he quit Fox to journey for a while in the South Pacific. Together with documentary film pioneer Robert Flaherty, Murnau travelled to Bora Bora to realize the film Tabu in 1931. <bop>Flaherty<eop> left after artistic disputes with Murnau who had to finish the movie on <bop>his<eop> own.
True	As a young artist in Berlin, <bop>Elisabet Ney<eop> had sculpted various luminaries of the city, including Jacob Grimm, Cosima Liszt, and Alexander von Humboldt. Ney had been patronized by the naturalist Humboldt, sculptor Christian Rauch, and diplomat Varnhagen von Ense; when all three died between late 1857 and mid 1859, <bop>she<eop> decided to travel Germany in search of new notable subjects.
False	Pinter wrote The Room over two or four days in 1957, depending on the account, at the suggestion of his friend Henry Woolf for his production as part of a postgraduate program in directing at the University of Bristol, Bristol, England. In their published interviews, Pinter and <bop>Woolf<eop> vary in describing how many days Pinter took to write The Room. According to Billington, in <bop>his<eop> official biography Harold Pinter, Woolf asked Pinter to write the play in a letter that Pinter received in the autumn of 1956, when he ``was newly married'' to actress Vivien Merchant ``and in the middle of a season at Torquay''; ``(Pinter) replied that he couldn't possibly deliver anything in under six months.
True	He is currently the wide receivers coach for Bowling Green. Doege was born in San Angelo, Texas, to Randy and Melinda Doege. He has one younger brother. Randy Doege coached at several high schools in West Texas before becoming the head coach at Crane High School in 2003. In <bop>his<eop> freshman season, 2004, <bop>Seth Doege<eop> was the starting quarterback for Crane High School and led the Golden Cranes to the area round of the playoffs, a loss to the (Tuscola) Jim Ned Indians, who were led by senior quarterback Colt McCoy.
False	The next year, though only a lieutenant-colonel, he was selected by Sir Ralph Abercromby to be quartermaster-general of his army in the Mediterranean, at the same time that another young Scotsman, John Hope, who was also to gain fame in Moore's retreat, was nominated adjutant-general. Sir <bop>Ralph<eop> placed the greatest confidence in Anstruther, and it was mainly on <bop>his<eop> report, after a visit to the Turkish headquarters, that the Turks would not be ready for a long time, if they could be of any use at all, that Sir Ralph left Marmorice Bay and determined to act alone.
True	At least one band member wrote every song on the album. Josh Osborne, Shane McAnally, and Dann Huff served as producers. Allmusic reviewer <bop>Stephen Thomas Erlewine<eop> rated the album 4 out of 5 stars, comparing its sound favorably to Alabama and Dwight Yoakam. <bop>He<eop> also stated that ``the three members construct sturdy songs with a shimmering surface to match.''
False	He helped to engineer the annexation to the city of the heavily African-American and impoverished ``Samtown'' subdivision in south Alexandria. The neighborhood was named for its white developer, Sam Jacobs. In annexing Samtown, <bop>Snyder<eop> was borrowing a page from Earl Long, who attempted to register black voters in the 1950s in anticipation of most supporting <bop>him<eop> politically in the future.
False	In a May 2010 Social Weather Stations opinion poll, AKB topped the survey, with 5.64% of the vote, the equivalent of two seats, beating seasoned party-list election contenders Buhay Hayaan Yumabong and Bayan Muna. However, AKB has been accused by the <bop>Kontra Daya<eop> (Against Cheating) group of being a creation of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to expand <bop>her<eop> base of allies in the House of Representatives, a charge that AKB denied.
False	Following an unsuccessful application for the Chair of Mathematics at Aberystwyth in 1872, he taught at the Training College in Carmarthen. He finally secured the professorship at Aberystwyth in 1879, and held it until 1919. Along the way his title became Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy. <bop>Genese<eop> introduced into the United Kingdom the ideas of Hermann Grassmann (advancing the use of vector analysis). In <bop>his<eop> 1941 book The calculus of extensions, Henry Forder published numerous examples in vector analysis taken from Genese's posthumous notes.
False	In 1984, Petersen married Zina Nibley, a daughter of Hugh Nibley. They have four children and reside in Provo, Utah. Petersen has been a lecturer in the honors program at BYU, and for the English and Humanities Departments at Utah Valley University, where he received a Faculty Excellence Award in 2006. Through <bop>his<eop> familial relationship to <bop>Hugh Nibley<eop>, Petersen authored the 2002 biography Hugh Nibley:
False	In the series finale, Charlotte and Harry adopt a baby girl, Lily, from China. In the movie, Sex and the City, she and Harry have a biological baby girl, whom they name <bop>Rose<eop>. As seen in episode 8 of season 6, the New York Times wedding announcement of <bop>her<eop> and Harry's marriage indicates that Charlotte is a writer and editor for Fashions Magazine, but as this fact is not mentioned at any other time in the series or subsequent movies, it is possible it is merely a prop error- the rest of the newspaper has paragraphs taken from Big and Natasha's wedding announcement in Season 3.
True	However, the real power lies with Philip who is declared commander of the League's army. Olympias is put aside by her husband Philip II, following Philip's marriage to a girl named Cleopatra (who is renamed Eurydice). Their son, Alexander, is effectively disowned by Philip's actions. <bop>Philip II<eop> has Ptolemy, along with other companions of <bop>his<eop> son, exiled.
False	The new Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, described Kane's allegations as ``unfounded'' to Parliament, and as a consequence Waddell inferred to a journalist that his report had not concluded that Kane's allegations were unfounded. <bop>Waddell<eop> married his wife, Dorothy, in 1940, <bop>she<eop> died in 2001.
False	It gained its first representation immediately after the 1997 election, when Puri Ruing, who had been elected for the People's Resources Awareness Party, joined the party. The party initially supported the government of <bop>Bill Skate<eop>, but later supported the government of Mekere Morauta, with Ruing made a minister in <bop>his<eop> government.
True	Detective Roe appears, and reveals he is the patriarch of the cannibal family, and the father of Leatherface (who he refers to as ``Gary''). Vanessa never escaped, the hospital room is just one of the family's sheds. Roe pulls a sheet over <bop>Vanessa<eop>'s head, and he and Daisy beat <bop>her<eop> to death with a wrench.
True	The musical style is essentially tonal, evoking the work's period setting through galops and marches; instrumental interludes are highly programmatic, and choral ensembles make use of original onomatopoeic devices. The music of Treasure Island is more adventurous; colorful hornpipes are used, but the language is richly chromatic and there is considerable rhythmic intensity. Through <bop>his<eop> editorial work, <bop>Elkus<eop> has focused on the music of Charles Ives.
True	Later in the day, he announced the reappointment of Paul Biyoghe Mba as Prime Minister; he made the announcement personally ``to underline the importance of this moment''. According to <bop>Bongo<eop>, Biyoghe Mba had the necessary experience and managerial competence ``to lead us through the next stage'', and <bop>he<eop> said work would start ``immediately''.
True	Finally Tony marries Anne which irks Daniel. Soon life starts disturbing Anne as she finds out that Tony was actually cheating her as he is a conman. Tony explain her why he became a conman and his past struggling life. In between <bop>Daniel<eop> gets killed by Tony as <bop>he<eop> tries to rape Anne.

True	When onlookers expressed doubt, claiming that the Proctor family was well regarded in the community, the girl promptly came out of her trance and told them it was all for ``sport''. On March 29, 1692, Abigail Williams and Mercy Lewis again said they were being tormented by Elizabeth's spectre. A few days later, <bop>Abigail<eop> complained that Elizabeth was pinching <bop>her<eop> and tearing at her bowels, and said she saw Elizabeth's spectre as well as John's.
False	The explanation offered by Muirhead is more prosaic than the fanciful rumours suggested. He examined the clothing left behind in the lighthouse and concluded that James Ducat and <bop>Thomas Marshall<eop> had gone down to the western landing stage, and that Donald MacArthur (the 'Occasional') had left the lighthouse during heavy rain in <bop>his<eop> shirt sleeves.
False	After a few years of almost no work -- although he was a guest star on Lou Grant and Charlie's Angels in the late 1970s, he once summed up the 1970s as ``I cried and did a lot of gardening'' -- he was hired in 1979 for his best-known role, self-made millionaire Palmer Cortlandt on ABC's long-running soap opera All My Children. Initially hired for only one year, he remained on contract through 2009. For much of his first decade on the show, Palmer was a ruthless villain, totally possessive of his daughter, <bop>Nina<eop> and violently threatening his ex-wife Daisy with being attacked by dobermans when <bop>she<eop> came back from the dead.
False	O'Neill was elected as part of a four-member team called ``Feminist Leadership NOW'' that took office July 21, 2009. <bop>Bonnie Grabenhofer<eop> of Illinois is executive vice president, Erin Matson from Minnesota became action vice president, and Allendra Letsome of Maryland became membership vice president. O'Neill resigned from <bop>her<eop> position as chief of staff to Councilwoman Duchy Trachtenberg of Montgomery County, Maryland in June 2009, to work full-time for NOW.
True	Alice's eldest daughter, Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven was heir presumptive to Queen Elizabeth I. She married secondly in 1600 Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley. <bop>Alice<eop> was born in Althorpe, Northamptonshire, England on 4 May 1559, the youngest daughter of Sir John Spencer, Member of Parliament and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, and Katherine Kytson. <bop>She<eop> had three brothers and three older sisters.
True	Davidson was hired on January 24, 2007 as the offensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers. Having worked as a member of the New England Patriots ' staff under Charlie Weis, Davidson forged a close relationship with him. Weis is a good friend of Panthers head coach John Fox, and it is believed that his recommendation was instrumental in Fox's decision to hire <bop>Davidson<eop>. With <bop>his<eop> playing and coaching experience at the offensive line and additional coaching with tight ends, most believe this hire meant that Coach Fox wanted to keep his focus on a powerful offense based around a strong running game, as has been his tendency in the past.
True	It is picked up by a bystander, emptied of its cash, and shoved into a wastebasket. Without the wallet, there is no way to immediately identify the body as Bullard. <bop>George Caswell<eop>, a member of the Tredway board of directors and one of the investment bankers with whom Bullard had just met, sees what <bop>he<eop> believes is Bullard's body in the street below their offices and decides to profit from the information.
False	Caswell begins to doubt that it was Bullard who died, but when he reads in a newspaper that the man had the initials ``A.B.'' on his clothes and cufflinks, he calls the police to tip them off to the identity of the deceased. Bullard had never named his successor. Over the next 28 hours, Tredway's executives vie for the position of president. Once news of <bop>his<eop> death reaches Tredway, company controller <bop>Loren Shaw<eop> takes the initiative in arranging Bullard's funeral and coordinating the company's public reaction.
False	Around 1125 W*adys*aw married Agnes of Babenberg, daughter of Margrave Leopold III of Austria; this union gave him a close connection with the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Germany: Agnes by her mother was a granddaughter of Emperor <bop>Henry IV<eop> and a half-sister of the Franconian duke Conrad III of Hohenstaufen, the later King of Germany. Thanks to W*adys*aw, Silesia was saved during the wars of 1133--1135 with Bohemia: <bop>he<eop> stopped the destruction of the major areas of his district after the Bohemian forces crossed the Oder river.
True	In the second act, Victor's apartment is shown from a different angle, and the Krap home is still visible. For much of the act, that part of the stage is empty, except for a moment where Jacques lights the lamp and paws his master's armchair. At one point, <bop>Victor<eop> arrives, and Jacques allows <bop>him<eop> to sit in his father's chair.
False	Vybz Kartel started his career as a teenager in 1993 with his first recording ``Love Fat Woman'', released on Alvin Reid's label ``One Heart'', using the moniker ``Adi Banton'', as homage to Buju Banton. Palmer was later part of the three-member group ``<bop>Vybz Cartel<eop>'', keeping the name after the group split up, and became a protege of Bounty Killer, for whom <bop>he<eop> claims to have written nearly 30 songs, including ``Gal Clown''.
True	Re-elected in the 2007 election, she was re-named the Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and for the Estrie Region as well as the Vice-Chair of the Treasury Board. Following her 2008 re-election, <bop>Gagnon-Tremblay<eop> gave up for portfolio of International Relations to Pierre Arcand but was given the position of President of the Treasury Board previously occupied by Monique Jerome-Forget who was also responsible for the portfolio of finances. <bop>She<eop> was given Jerome-Forget's government administration portfolio duties until 2010.
False	<bop>Ralph Inzunza<eop> was a San Diego City Council District Eight representative elected in February 2001 who resigned in 2005 along with Councilman Michael Zucchet after being involved in a corruption scandal. They were convicted of extortion, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking campaign contributions from a strip club owner and <bop>his<eop> associates, allegedly in exchange for trying to repeal the city's ``no touch'' laws at strip clubs.
False	Donald P. Kanak is non-executive Chairman of Prudential Corporation Asia, the Asian division of Prudential plc. Until 2006 he was a senior executive at American International Group, and was at one time considered to succeed <bop>Hank Greenberg<eop> as CEO. After beginning <bop>his<eop> career in management consulting, Kanak entered the insurance and financial services industry in 1986.
True	His work as an arranger, producer and songwriter throughout the subsequent decades has brought him into contact with the leading Latin artists of the day, including Roc*o D*rcal and Isabel Pantoja.

True	Reviewer Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone that ``Streep--at her brilliant, beguiling best--is the spice that does the trick for the yummy Julie & Julia.''

True	Asha Randall Asha Randall (born 6 April 1990) is an English synchronised swimmer who represented Great Britain in the team event at the 2012 London Olympics. <bop>Asha<eop> is the younger sister of synchronized swimmer Jenna Randall.

False	The next day HMS Fawn, under the command of Captain Thomas Fellowes, encountered Rachel and captured her, together with the 12-man prize crew of Americans. The British took the Americans on board <bop>Fawn<eop> and put a six-man prize crew on board Rachel, which they sent <bop>her<eop> into Jamaica, where the Vice admiralty court condemned her as a prize.
True	At the emergency room, the baby was pronounced dead. Suspicion mounted against Tinning, who was always alone when the children died, but there wasn't any evidence of wrongdoing. However, after a police interrogation, <bop>Tinning<eop> confessed to smothering Tami Lynne, Nathan, and Timothy (which <bop>she<eop> later retracted).
False	Towards the end of Edward's reign, Alice was accused of making his life a misery and of luring him with her charms only to further her own personal ambitions. According to <bop>Charles Cawley<eop>, Perrers had three illegitimate children by King Edward, all while their relationship was a secret from <bop>his<eop> wife, Queen Philippa and the public.
True	<bop>Alice Perrers<eop> is the protagonist of Emma Campion's novel, The King's Mistress. <bop>She<eop> appears in Anya Seton's novel, Katherine.

Another homeroom teacher, who has just killed <bop>her<eop> own entire class, finds and kills Taeko and Sur.
False	He informs Blackadder and Baldrick, ``For us, a toilet is a mundane, functional item. For you it is the basis of an entire culture!'' Before retiring to his chateau, Richthofen comments that, ``Gallant Lord Flashheart still eludes me.'' Soon after, Flashheart and <bop>Lieutenant George<eop> arrive to rescue their fellow flyers. At last facing <bop>his<eop> greatest adversary, Richthofen launches into a tedious soliloquy about chivalry and honor.
False	The babies have an awards show, and the awards go to all of the others (Stu, Fluffy, and almost Angelica). The babies fear Dil is stronger than they are. Chas thinks of a name for the puppy. Phil and Lil think a visiting friend is a disaster. Tommy, <bop>Angelica<eop>, and Susie compete in a pet show. Tommy misunderstands Taffy when he hears <bop>her<eop> say she doesn't want pickles on her burger, thinking that she is referring to Dil when she says ``I don't like dill pickles''.
False	Her world is perfectly ordered until young working-class girl, Sharon Wilkes (Beverley) is hired as the new office secretary. Initially prone to be snobbish, Elsie soon learns to appreciate Sharon and the two become friends.

False	Heightened political pressure and illness pushed Gordillo out from public life for about a year, though she did hold on to her post as the PRI secretary general. In early 2005 Gordillo returned to public life and Roberto Madrazo greeted her with open arms. According to PRI rules, Gordillo, as secretary general of the party, should have replaced Madrazo when <bop>he<eop> stepped down; but, in a surprise move, <bop>Mariano Palacios Alcocer<eop> took Madrazo's position instead of Gordillo, who publicly broke with Madrazo just few days before Palacios Alcocer's election.
True	Oliveira would take a major step forward with a dramatic come-from-behind win against undefeated prospect (8--0 with 8 knockouts) Phil Williams. In that fight Oliveira was knocked down twice but rallied to knock Williams out in the seventh round. In January 2009 Oliveira defeated veteran Rayco Saunders by majority decision. In <bop>his<eop> most recent bout <bop>Oliveira<eop> defeated Otis Griffin by second-round knockout on June 5 at Grand Casino Hinckley in Minnesota.
False	The series was recorded in front of a live audience and each 30 minute episode was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 at 1pm, making some of the rude, and occasionally crude, jokes rather risqu* for the time of day. Hudd, Emmett, and <bop>Whitfield<eop> had all worked together on the very long-running radio series The News Huddlines. Holland is a familiar voice in British comedy series, probably best known for <bop>his<eop> role as Spike Dixon, the camp comic at Maplin's holiday camp, Crimpton-on-Sea, in the BBC sitcom Hi-de-Hi!

False	At the same time, Lady Elle secretly meets with the Council of Waya to tell them about her conviction that Lyka's the ``last protector'' they have been waiting for to save their clan when the next lunar eclipse occurs. As it is, some of the members are already tired of running away from their normal lives because of the curse. Unbeknownst to them, Lyka is slowly transforming into a wolf by then!

True	That was the time when the raja (A prince, chief, or ruler in India) of Sheeroo Dynasty was disobeying the authority of King of Delhi, King Feroz Shah Tughlaq.

True	Indrajith's role is that of a police officer who was tagged as a ``loser'' and hence different from other traditional cop roles. <bop>Asha Sarath<eop> was signed to play a journalist named Haritha, with the actress stating that Haritha was ``as unscrupulous as Geetha'', <bop>her<eop> character in Drishyam.

False	He hosted the William B. Williams Show in the morning hours, and Music in a Sentimental Mood in the afternoon from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. In 1954, the originator of the Make Believe Ballroom program in New York, Martin Block, left WNEW for a new job at ABC Radio. <bop>Jerry Marshall<eop> took over the show for three years, after which Williams was tapped to host the program. <bop>He<eop> marked the broadcast as his own, using the distinctive sign-on, ``Hello, world'', and occasionally identifying himself as ``Guilliermo B.

True	Miller is also currently serving as the producing artistic director at Surflight Theatre in Beach Haven, New Jersey, on Long Beach Island.

False	The group then moved on to their AWA run, returned to World Class, and then started a stint in the UWF where Gordy became the promotion's champion, Roberts held its TV title, and Hayes usually acted as their manager or served as a heel commentator on television broadcasts. After JCP purchased UWF in 1987, <bop>Hayes<eop> wrestled in World Class and several independent promotions, sometimes with Gordy, who began spending most of <bop>his<eop> time in Japan, and Roberts began to wind down his career.
True	The film was on the ``Best Films'' list of over 20 national critics and was nominated for a Spirit Award for Best Screenplay by Savoca and Guay.

False	The film follows the courtship and marriage of Catherine Falconetti (Ullman) to local butcher Joseph Santangelo (D'Onofrio), as well as Catherine's relationship with her overbearing Old World mother-in-law (Judith Malina). The film also focuses on <bop>Catherine<eop> and Joseph's daughter Teresa (Taylor), a devout Catholic more similar to <bop>her<eop> superstitious grandmother than with her modernized and secularized parents.
True	Isabel Walker is a twenty-something American film-school dropout who decides to visit her step-sister Roxanne, a poet who now lives in France. Isabel believes that she is there to help Roxanne during her pregnancy with her toddler infant, but later realizes that her father and step-mother sent her there so that Roxanne would help the shiftless Isabel gain some direction in life. Shortly after <bop>she<eop> arrives, <bop>Roxanne<eop> confides in Isabel that her French husband, Claude-Henri has left her.
False	Learning the news they return home only to find from Roxanne that Claude-Henri has decided to agree with Roxanne's wishes that the painting be left out of the divorce and instead be willed to their children. The rest of the family is incensed at Roxanne and demand she sell the painting.

In 1594, at the death of <bop>Diane<eop>'s granddaughter Charlotte de la Marck, the ch*teau passed to <bop>her<eop> husband, Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon, who sold it to a tax farmer Largentier, who had grown rich on gathering in the salt tax called the gabelle.
True	Rocky travels to Dubai, where his friend Babloo (Vijay Raaz) has already tracked down Tanya, who has become Natasha, a successful singer and performer. Rocky and Babloo stakeout Natasha's villa to make sure they are on the right track, but as soon as <bop>Rocky<eop> spots Natasha, it's love at first sight. While <bop>he<eop> has Natasha under surveillance, Karan and Murugan arrive at the Dubai airport from India.
True	Rocky intervenes, and after seemingly beating the living daylights out of the supposed thugs (the scene is similar to Jean-Claude Van Damme's introductory action sequence from Hard Target (1993)), introduces himself to Natasha, and proceeds to show himself off as a charming professional with a heart of gold. Somewhat awed, Natasha offers Rocky an invitation for tea later in the evening, which he accepts. When Rocky arrives at <bop>her<eop> villa later in the evening, he is confronted by several obstacles, <bop>Natasha<eop>'s sister Sweety (Supriya Pilgaonkar), the jealous Tommy and the family's pet dog.
False	He quoted extensively from Scottish jurist Baron Hume, and American psychiatrist Isaac Ray. Witnesses were produced from Glasgow to give evidence about M'Naghten's odd behaviour and complaints of persecution. The defence then called on a number of medical witnesses, including Dr Edward Monro, Sir <bop>Alexander Morison<eop>, and Dr Forbes Winslow, who testified that M'Naghten's delusions had deprived <bop>him<eop> of ``all restraint over his actions''.

False	As described by Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone, ``The video opens on an art gallery filled with photos of Bieber's silhouette before shifting to the singer offering an emotional delivery of the track in a dark room.

True	The administration of Jewish communal affairs in Jerusalem had fallen into the hands of iniquitous officials. The poor were harshly taxed for the Muslim government; the rich were similarly treated and driven from the city by exorbitant demands upon them, so that the Jewish community was on the brink of ruin. In a letter written to <bop>his<eop> brother from Jerusalem on 24 August 1489, <bop>Obadiah<eop> mentions that Jews flock to Jerusalem from Egypt, Damascus, Aleppo and other places in order to worship God.

Keys released <bop>her<eop> second album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, in December 2003.
False	Homer's epics stand at the beginning of the western canon of literature, exerting enormous influence on the history of fiction and literature in general.

False	As tempting as it can be to think of Liszt as the father of modern music on the basis of his late music, looking at his achievements in these works as ends in themselves would be erroneous. Liszt's technical achievements in his late music are one side of a more complex picture. Along with the increasing interest in Hungarian and other national schools of composition already mentioned, essential parts of this picture are tragedy in Liszt's personal life and developments in his friendship with <bop>Wagner<eop>. In <bop>his<eop> later years Liszt's problems with health, both physical and mental, affected his ability to complete compositions.

False	She appears in a bathtub towards the end of Red Robin #11 as one of Ra's Al Ghul 's targets, identified as Bruce's first love, until she was rescued by Man-Bat, which shocks and scares her. A version of <bop>Julie Madison<eop> appeared in the 1997 film Batman & Robin, played by Elle Macpherson. Many of <bop>her<eop> scenes were edited out of the film's final cut, thus she is the only film love interest of Batman's to not have a prominent role.

Buenos Aires deposed the viceroy in 1810, during the May Revolution, who was replaced by the Primera Junta. <bop>Mariano Moreno<eop>, secretary of war, wrote at the Operations plan that Artigas would be a descisive ally against the royalists in Montevideo, and called <bop>him<eop> for an interview.

False	Haggard had enjoyed an immensely successful artistic and commercial run with Capitol and producer Ken Nelson, accumulating twenty-four #1 country singles since 1966. According to music journalist Daniel Cooper's essay for the 1994 <bop>Haggard<eop> retrospective Down Every Road, there was no animosity or disillusionment with the Capitol brass, and the change was made simply because MCA had made a better offer.

True	The four-second fall from the Golden Gate Bridge sends a person plunging 245 feet (75 m) at 75 miles per hour (121 km/h) to hit the waters of the San Francisco Bay ``with the force of a speeding truck meeting a concrete building.'' Jumping off the bridge holds a 98 percent fatality rate; some die instantly from internal injuries, while others drown or die of hypothermia. In <bop>his<eop> article for The New Yorker, <bop>Tad Friend<eop> wrote, ``Survivors often regret their decision in midair, if not before,'' supported by survivor Ken Baldwin explaining, ``I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable--except for having just jumped.''
False	At age 17, Rinker moved to Seattle and worked as a sheet music demonstrator at Woolworth's. She married and divorced Ted Bailey, keeping his last name because she thought it sounded more ``American'' than <bop>Rinker<eop>, which was of Swiss (German) origin. With the help of <bop>her<eop> second husband Benny Stafford, Bailey became an established blues and jazz singer on the west coast of the United States.
False	When Gao received this news, he became even more respectful of Liang. In the aftermaths of Emperor Zhuangzong's death, Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan claimed imperial title (as Emperor Mingzong). Meanwhile, Gao Jixing prepared his fleet and wanted to attack <bop>Chu<eop>. <bop>His<eop> official Sun Guangxian, whom Liang Zhen had recommended to him to be his scribe, pointed out that Jingnan had barely recovered from the wars, and if it were engaged in a war with Chu, other states might take advantage and attack Jingnan.

True	His best result was winning U.S.A. F11 at Harbour Island, Florida without dropping a set, where he beat unseeded Barbadian Haydn Lewis in the final, 6-2, 7-6. This result, securing him 17 ATP points, saw his ranking soar by exactly 100 places. In doubles, <bop>Bester<eop> and compatriot Vasek Pospisil reached the quarter-finals of U.S.A. F5. The following week <bop>he<eop> and another Canadian, Kamil Pajkowski, also reached the quarters, this time of Canada F1.

False	Llewellyn failed to take a wicket in this first Test and was promptly omitted from the remainder of the series but responded by performing impressively in the 1897--98 and 1898--99 Currie Cups, which led to his recall to the national team for the first Test of the 1898--99 series against England. Llewellyn impressed by taking five wickets but was surprisingly left out of the second Test. At the end of the 1898--99 series <bop>Llewellyn<eop>, perturbed by the actions of the selectors and seeking financial security, left South Africa to play for English county side Hampshire County Cricket Club as a professional, on the recommendation of South African team-mate Major Robert Poore, an ex-Hampshire cricketer on military assignment. <bop>He<eop> would star for Hampshire for over a decade, scoring 8772 runs at 27.58 and snaring 711 wickets at 24.66.

False	Much contemporary poetry fits into one of the many aesthetic categories that lie between the polar opposites of the radically ``experimental'' poem and the ``traditional,'' often formal, poem. Dorothy Barresi's work, however, is singular in its resistance, better yet, rejection, of current poetic camps. Part <bop>Sylvia Plath<eop>, part John Donne, Barresi handles both surprise and expectation with deftness, displaying uncommon verbal ingenuity and intelligence of investigation. <bop>Her<eop> third book, Rouge Pulp, spins poems of startling metaphysical image shot through with slang and pop culture.
True	On May 23, 2009, O'Neal defeated the debuting Jayme Jameson after Krissy Vaine switched with her to become the first NWA Charlotte Women's Champion.

False	Because Dante scholars have failed to recognize this systematic allegorical function of Dante's epic, Seung maintains, they have reduced it to a grand Human Comedy, in which the mass of humanity Dante encounters in his journey can hardly leave any room for the presence of <bop>God<eop>. By <bop>his<eop> trinitarian reading, Seung securely installs the Holy Trinity as the epic hero of Dante poem.
False	In an interview conducted with FightLockdown prior to his UFC debut, Villefort stated, ``The greatest moment my career would have to be when I was in the IFL, when I fought Mike Massenzio. At the time I had only recently opened up my first gym and wasn't training enough for that fight. Everyone was saying Massenzio was ``gonna kill me'', but I believed in God, in my Judo, and in my Jiu-Jitsu skills, accepted the fight and I did what I did. Massenzio is very strong guy!'' When asked about his post-fight celebration which entails firing an invisible arrow at his opponents, <bop>Villefort<eop> stated that ``it is just a way to do tribute for my Dad, <bop>he<eop> deserves more than that, but when I shoot the arrow I make him happy!

True	He later starred in other films such as Sawan Ko Aane Do (1979), Saanch Ko Aanch Nahin (1979), Ayaash (1982) and Itni Si Baat (1981). <bop>Ramanand Sagar<eop> cast Govil as Vikramaditya in <bop>his<eop> television series Vikram Aur Betaal and Ram in his highly successful television series Ramayan, for which he won the Uptron Award for ``Best Actor in a Leading Role'' in 1988.
True	Granell was one of those exiles from a very early age. France, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Guatemala and New York were his places of residence.

False	Mary Poppins also had a very similar attitude while actively encouraging positive imagination (Susan tends to say things like ``Real children don't go hoppity-skip unless they're on drugs''), took children on magical adventures (Susan does so to teach geography), introduced children to supernatural creatures (Susan employs such beings as guest speakers, including her own grandfather), and had a magic umbrella (which, while not used as a blunt object, was magical much like Death's scythe). Neither character openly acknowledges her magical powers. Both tend toward being actively insulted when reminded of their use. The link between Susan and <bop>Mary Poppins<eop> is explicitly alluded to in Hogfather, when Susan states that ``<bop>She<eop>'d sworn that if she did indeed ever find herself dancing on rooftops with chimney sweeps, she'd beat herself to death with her own umbrella.''
False	Gooden claimed that an enraged Mitchell held him hostage during the alleged cat incident. Mitchell responded to Gooden's accusations by accusing Gooden of fabricating the stories in an attempt to divert attention away from Gooden's personal problems. In the famous tenth inning of Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, after Wally Backman and <bop>Keith Hernandez<eop> had been retired for the first two outs, Mitchell went to the clubhouse to make plane reservations for home in San Diego. However, <bop>he<eop> was called to pinch hit for reliever Rick Aguilera after Gary Carter, the next hitter after Hernandez, singled.

True	The president of SAG -- future United States President <bop>Ronald Reagan<eop> -- also known to the FBI as Confidential Informant ``T-10'', testified before the committee but never publicly named names. Instead, according to an FBI memorandum in 1947: ``T-10 advised Special Agent (name deleted) that <bop>he<eop> has been made a member of a committee headed by Mayer, the purpose of which is allegedly is to 'purge' the motion-picture industry of Communist party members, which committee was an outgrowth of the Thomas committee hearings in Washington and subsequent meetings ....
False	By traveling up the north side of the Potomac River, which was easier because of the mountainous terrain on the south side, the party missed the stream which gives the town its name. On the return trip, however, the explorers discovered the stream and subsequently placed it on the map as a ``new creek.'' Together with Professor <bop>Alexander Irvin<eop>, Mayo was also responsible for setting the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina. One of the rivers intersecting the line was named the Mayo River in <bop>his<eop> honor.

While Vince wanted to promote <bop>her<eop> as the definitive General Manager of the show, Triple H voted for the resignation of Guerrero.

As a result, the championship was returned to the now heel-turned Hennig. Stemming from the events of that match, <bop>Stevens<eop> feuded briefly with Zbyszko before finishing out <bop>his<eop> career in 1992, after 42 years.
True	He was even caught and photographed naked on set. Co-star Madeline Wool and the actress who played 'Broccoli woman' managed to resist his overly aggressive advances. The Broccoli actress even asked <bop>Marenghi<eop> to remove Todd from the series which, of course, <bop>he<eop> could not do.
False	They attempted this by beating the fire with long stage poles. The curtains rose while backstage personnel hastened to bring the fire under control, the actors beginning the scene. After speaking a few lines, <bop>Claxton<eop> was made aware of the fire by Lillian Cleaves, another actress backstage who was standing behind the box set. <bop>She<eop> whispered sotto voce through the canvas of the boathouse that there was fire on stage and urged them to leave.

True	Following the death of Tewodros II's much loved first wife, Empress Tewabech Ali (who was Tiruwork's niece), his intimates began to discreetly look for an appropriate consort to provide him with an heir and to calm his more extreme moods as his late wife had done. Legend states that one of the Emperor's officers was attending Sunday services at a church at Derasge when <bop>Tewodros<eop> was staying there, and was struck at the beauty, the aristocratic deportment, and the deep piety of a woman worshiping there. <bop>He<eop> immediately went to the Emperor and told him he had seen the woman ``meant to be the wife of my sovereign''.

True	This, he charged, should be devoted to the souls of himself, his wife, Kings Henry IV and V, and to each past, present and future member of the Order of the Garter.

True	He lost popularity with his players, whose views of him became hateful, and that is seen as a factor in the Black Sox scandal, when eight players on the AL champions conspired to ``throw'' the 1919 World Series to the NL champion Cincinnati Reds. Comiskey was notoriously stingy (his defenders called him ``frugal''), even forcing his players to pay to launder their own uniforms. <bop>Traci Peterson<eop> notes that, in an era when professional athletes lacked free agency, the White Sox's formidable players had little choice but to accept Comiskey's substandard wages. <bop>She<eop> writes: ``Charles Risberg and Claude Williams made less than $3,000 a year.

In June 1690, a Williamite army of 30,000 men camped in the Scarva area for training before marching on to meet the forces of <bop>King James II<eop> at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690.

True	A few days later, McClusky allegedly saw his hat in a Broadway store under a sign which read ``Step in and buy a Merry Widow. The kind wore by Inspector McClusky, the swellest cop in the world''. Two years later, <bop>McClusky<eop> became a police inspector and assigned to the Fifth District by Commissioner Francis V. Greene. At 42 years old, <bop>he<eop> was the youngest man in the NYPD to hold the position.
True	Robinson had not even brought his boots for the match and borrowed Starling's. He scored the goal in a 1--1 draw. Five days later <bop>Robinson<eop> was a non-playing member of the Wednesday squad which beat West Bromwich 4--2 in the FA Cup final. Conscious of <bop>his<eop> young age, Billy Walker only used Robinson occasionally in the 1935--36 season, and he made just five appearances.
True	Walters also co-founded Unknown Public in 1992 and works as a writer and editor. Pask worked as a sessions player and co-wrote the theme music for the long-running British ITV series The Bill. <bop>Thoms<eop> later appeared on Thomas Dolby's 1984 album The Flat Earth and toured with Dolby that year playing trombone. <bop>He<eop> also served as a member of staff at the Musicians' Union's head office in Britain.
True	Ellison's recollection is that ``Kent, my county, were playing a game against Leicestershire in July and I approached captain David Gower and said: 'I'm going to make you pick me. ' I soon started to take wickets and was called into the squad for the fourth Test in Manchester.'' <bop>Ellison<eop> took 3--58 in the first-class match, including Gower's wicket in the only innings in which <bop>he<eop> bowled.
True	Writing a decade later, George C*linescu noted that Ruinelor Cet**ii Neam*u was ``a disgraceful replica of C*rlova's Ruinurile T*rgovi*tii''. He also stressed the misogyny present in several lyrics authored by Hrisoverghi, which he defined as ``(having) the stray impulses of Romantic jokes and featuring ridiculous invectives''. In respect to this, he cited the stanza: Besides <bop>his<eop> translation of Dumas' novel, <bop>Alexandru Hrisoverghi<eop> is noted for those of poems by Ch*nier (to which he notably added his own verses), Friedrich Schiller (probably, through a French-language translation), Alphonse de Lamartine, and Victor Hugo.

False	She might look like butter wouldn't melt, but she's her father's daughter through and through.'' She was also described as conniving, backstabbing and cold-hearted. Altman described Dotty as ``a chip off the old block'', as did <bop>Nancy Banks-Smith<eop> from The Guardian though the Daily Record described Dotty as ``a chip off <bop>her<eop> grandma's block''.
False	She shifted to high school, working in Gu*nica between 1942 and 1957. In 1947 and again in 1955, she served as acting school principal. Her first marriage ended in divorce and on December 25, 1944, she married Ismael Olivieri. The couple subsequently had two daughters, <bop>Antonia<eop> and Rebeca Olivieri Figueroa. In 1947, <bop>she<eop> published her first book of poetry Acridulces, which was described by critics as neo-Romantic, but which placed her within the first generation of academic and professional Puerto Ricans known as the Generation of the 50s.
True	He missed weeks 6 through 8 with a sprained ankle. In week 11 against St. Louis, Williams filled in for Foster, who had injured his elbow, and totaled 20 carries for 114 yards. In a Monday Night Football game against the Philadelphia Eagles, <bop>Williams<eop> started for an injured DeShaun Foster and managed 74 rushing yards on 17 carries and an impressive 101 receiving yards on 7 catches with a touchdown. <bop>He<eop> had 501 rushing yards and 1 touchdown on the year.
False	Robinson composed An American Requiem, which had its New England Premiere under the direction of Dr. Robert Russell and the USM Chorale. He also wrote ``Driving Old Memories'' with his father <bop>Ervin Robinson<eop>, and the country song ``Momma Never Had Life Easy -- So She Made Life Easy for Me''. In 2012 <bop>he<eop> wrote the music for the independent documentary In the Shadows of Grey Gardens In an article entitled ``Robinson and Ragtime'', David Welker called him ``one of today's leading proponents of early jazz and ragtime music''.
True	Warner with the suggestion she and her sisters star in the film. Warner agreed, and <bop>Leota<eop> was summoned from New York to test for the part of Emma, but proved unsuitable. The studio substituted Gale Page, a young contractee as the fourth daughter. The actress would be tagged for the rest of <bop>her<eop> career as the fourth Lane.
False	Since EDS had its own stock, there was an inherent conflict of interest between the companies- an EDS employee working in Detroit at a GM plant was not primarily concerned about GM's performance, but about EDS performance, so they had a blank check to throw money at problems, bill GM, and watch their EDS stock go up. Finally, as Lee quotes Perot - ``GM doesn't honor its contracts'' - Smith had said <bop>he<eop> would not interfere with <bop>Perot<eop>, but the relationship fractured from the start, with conflicts over promised compensation to EDS executives being rejected by Smith, who also sent auditors to EDS to irritate Perot.
False	This army, known as the Atholl Highlanders, conducts largely social and ceremonial activities, and primarily consists of workers on the extensive Atholl Estates. The Castle no longer belongs directly to the Duke of Atholl, as the 10th <bop>Duke<eop>, George Iain Murray (1931--96), left the Castle in trust upon <bop>his<eop> death.
True	Jean-Gabriel De Tarde or Gabriel Tarde in short (12 March 1843, Sarlat-la-Can*da, Dordogne -- 13 May 1904, Paris) French sociologist, criminologist and social psychologist who conceived sociology as based on small psychological interactions among individuals (much as if it were chemistry), the fundamental forces being imitation and innovation. Among the concepts that <bop>Tarde<eop> initiated were the group mind (taken up and developed by Gustave Le Bon, and sometimes advanced to explain so-called herd behaviour or crowd psychology), and economic psychology, where <bop>he<eop> anticipated a number of modern developments.
True	On a personal note, there was an outstanding event in his life: he went back to his home country, Japan, in 1997 after 21 years of absence. In 1998 he was given the task to organize the first National Tournament ``Iwata Cup'' in Monterrey, NL, in partnership with Murayama Master. <bop>Toshiaki Nogiwa<eop> received the 7th Dan Shito-Ryu Karate-Do Sosei-Kai and 4th Dan Shinkyokuryu Taijitsu degreees. The Pan American Budo Nippon Soseikai appointed <bop>him<eop> as Technical Advisor in 2005.
False	The exhibition will display works of Mr. Kwan, many are shown on a loan basis with the kind consent of galleries and friends, as well as related articles, photos and information. It will not only provide a broad view of the creations of Mr. <bop>Kwan<eop>, a core figure of our art scene, but also an opportunity to look at the life of an enthusiastic and committed artist. Dedicated to <bop>his<eop> life to art making, Jerry used oil painting as his major medium of expression in his artwork.
False	Who was that ``Duke Knut'', Cecilia's historically mentioned father? Three sufficiently possible and credible alternatives have been proposed: * Knut Birgersson Jarl has been deemed somewhat uneasy choice because of chronological problems. That Knut died 1208, and because of her children's age and her own likely death date, Cecilia firstly need to have been born in the very end of Knut's life (c 1208) when <bop>Knut<eop> was already elderly (and several decades after birth of that Knut's other attested child/children); and even that makes Cecilia somewhat old for <bop>her<eop> own marriage and to give birth to her attested children, at last one of whom was executed in 1280 and Cecilia possibly was then living.
True	Finn, along with fellow original De Dannan member Johnny ``Ringo'' McDonagh, has recently reformed De Dannan with banjoist/keyboardist Brian McGrath, accordionist Derek Hickey, fiddler Mick Conneely, and singer Eleanor Shanley. <bop>Alec Finn<eop> is the older brother of the author Gervase Phinn. <bop>He<eop> changed the spelling of his surname form Phinn to Finn upon moving to Ireland from his childhood home in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.
False	He was also officially charged by Hassan II to prepare his visit to Washington D.C. from April 22nd to 27th, but was secretly told he had to conduct negotiations about secret US military bases in Morocco who pay a rent directly into the royal coffers . There, he also investigated why Pan American World Airways had decided against building an Intercontinental Hotel in Casablanca. In California, <bop>Medbouh<eop> discovered the reason : William P. Rogers, Secretary of State had received a file, from <bop>his<eop> friend the president of the Pan American World Airways, containing photocopies of letters from Morocco.
False	On completion of the initial version, David immediately began work on the second version which was finished on 25 May, the date of Bonaparte's inspection of the portraits at David's Louvre workshop. Two of David's pupils assisted him in producing the different versions: J*r*me-Martin Langlois worked primarily on the first two portraits, and <bop>George Rouget<eop> produced the copy for Les Invalides. In contrast to <bop>his<eop> predecessors Fran*ois Boucher and Jean-Honor* Fragonard, who employed a red or grey undercoat as a base colour on which to build up the painting, David employed the white background of the canvas directly underneath his colours, as some of his unfinished works show, such as his first attempt at a portrait of Bonaparte or his sketch of the Tennis Court Oath.
False	Some of the more intriguing articles range from ``A Psychopathological Discussion of Christ'' to ``The Pig in its Poetical, Mythological and Cultural-Historical Aspects.'' Among the literary works published during his Swiss exile in 1898 were the political satire Psichopatia Criminalis and the historical drama <bop>Nero<eop>. Throughout <bop>his<eop> Swiss sojourn, Panizza's mental health gradually began to deteriorate.
True	The King Cole Trio (featuring Jack Costanzo on bongos) recorded the song July 26, 1949. ``Boulevard of Broken Dreams'' is a signature song of Tony Bennett who was signed by Mitch Miller to Columbia Records on the strength of <bop>Bennett<eop>'s 1949 demo of the song. In <bop>his<eop> debut Columbia session on 17 April 1950 at CBS 30th Street Studio Bennett - backed by the Marty Manning orchestra - recorded ``Boulevard of Broken Dreams'' to serve as Bennett's major label debut single release on 27 April 1950.
False	The instrumental of ``Let It Go'' was mixed with the a capella of ``Addicted to You'' to become ``Addicted to You (Avicii by Avicii)''. On 29 December 2012, Bergling released ``I Could Be the One'' with <bop>Nicky Romero<eop>. After first being debuted at <bop>his<eop> shows almost a year earlier, the track finally got released via Bergling's record label LE7ELS.
False	A January 2015 issue of Newsweek magazine featured an article detailing reports of sexism and misogyny in Silicon Valley. The article's author, <bop>Nina Burleigh<eop>, asked, ``Where were all these offended people when women like Heidi Roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick <bop>her<eop> hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?''
True	Theresa, her brother Sancho and sister Urraca were the only children of Afonso and <bop>Matilda<eop> to survive to adulthood. Named after <bop>her<eop> paternal grandmother, Countess Theresa, she was reputedly King Afonso I's favourite.
False	But Gaiman also acknowledged that his Faerie was a fiction, a land where metaphor was made real but also remained metaphor: when Timothy Hunter was taken to the land by Doctor Occult, the mystic admitted that in some ways the two of them were still sitting in a field exploring only their inner landscapes. Gaiman also showed an ambiguous section that was interpreted by some to suggest that Queen Titania was the mother of the comic's main character, <bop>Timothy Hunter<eop>, which ensured that the realm of Faerie was further explored when the mini-series became an ongoing series. When <bop>he<eop> was chosen to replace Gaiman as the writer of the ongoing The Books of Magic series, John Ney Rieber discovered that a gaming guide to the DC universe had listed Titania as Hunter's mother: he also knew that a key part of the character's appeal, however, was that he was a normal teenaged boy.
False	Hugh Laing and Francisco Moncion also danced it before it lapsed from the performance rota for a decade. It was restaged in 1960 with Edward Villella in the title role (Villella recounts his work in recreating the role in his autobiography of the same name). <bop>Mikhail Baryshnikov<eop> danced it with City Ballet in 1979 and Damian Woetzel danced it at <bop>his<eop> farewell performance on Wednesday, 18 June 2008.
True	Later in 2009 he appeared alongside John Nettles, James Fox, Sylvestra le touzel, Frances Barber and Richard Fleeshman in the prestigious ITV Drama Series Midsomer Murders as the young manipulative concert pianist Orlando Guest in the episode titled ``Masterclass'' directed by Renny Rye. <bop>Thomas<eop> is currently appearing on Broadway as the alternate 'Peter Parker' in the Broadway theatre production of the musical . <bop>He<eop> is scheduled two shows weekly as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.
False	He inadvertently confronted a crowd of people gathered around a preacher, Nazir Ahmad Ali, who was to later become a pioneering missionary in Sierra Leone. Whilst Ali was preaching, a chief requested Salih to judge the message brought by <bop>Ali<eop>. With the exception of two things, which ``held <bop>his<eop> throat'', Salih found that the message coincided with the teachings of the Quran.
False	It is revealed that all superpowers come from Compound V, a drug invented by Nazi scientists; a low-powered version mixed with cocaine is called Blue, and it is used to attain a singular, powerful high (or, as revealed during the surveillance, allows prostitutes to endure or recover from sex with superhumans), but it carries a risk of spontaneous and horrifying mutations. Judging that <bop>he<eop> is suitable to join the team, <bop>Butcher<eop> injects Hughie with a specially formulated mix of V that gives him super-strength and durability--much to Hughie's chagrin.
True	Wade asks Daisy to marry him and the ceremony is held on the Swans' estate. On the first night of their honeymoon in Arizona, he drives off and leaves her. When she returns to Raymond's house, an extremely intoxicated <bop>Melora<eop> reveals to Daisy that <bop>she<eop> had an affair with the closet homosexual Wade.
False	In the mid-1930s, Daisy Clover is a teenage tomboy, living in a ramshackle trailer on a California beach with her eccentric mother Lucile. She dreams about becoming a Hollywood actress and submits a recorded song to a well-known film producer, Raymond Swan. Swan puts her under contract for five years.

False	The new 6th District was based around the eastern suburbs of Camden inclusive of Cherry Hill, stretching from Berlin borough north to Pennsauken and included Burlington County's Evesham Township and Palmyra. Croce and Gallagher defeated Republicans William K. Dickey, a former Speaker of the Assembly, and Eugene Raymond III. Croce and Gallagher were re-elected in 1975, again defeating both Dickey and Raymond. In 1977, <bop>Croce<eop> and running mate Barbara Berman, running in <bop>her<eop> first race for elected office, defeated Republicans Mario A.
False	In 1977, Croce and running mate Barbara Berman, running in her first race for elected office, defeated Republicans Mario A. Iavicoli and Dickey (for the third time); Croce was the top vote-getter and Berman came in second, edging Iavicoli by a 170-vote margin. When <bop>Berman<eop> and Croce took office in January 1978, <bop>she<eop> and Berman became the first pair of women to be elected to a single Assembly district in state history, and were two of the 12 women taking office in the Assembly, the highest number ever to serve together in the 80-seat body.
False	These laws kept people from declaring candidacy the day before an election, requiring the professio to be made before a certain set date. Politicians running for a position of power in the Roman Republic followed campaigning strategies similar to those used by modern politicians. In a contemporary letter written to consul candidate Marcus Cicero by <bop>his<eop> brother, <bop>Quintus<eop>, during Marcus' campaign, Quintus wrote on the various campaigning strategies that would help Marcus be elected.
False	In 1995, it was a finalist in the Benedictus Awards, described by the jury as ``a remarkable anti-structure ... a symbolic use of technology ... a piece of sculpture. It was meant as an object but it is an object to transmit light.'' The Inverted Pyramid figures prominently on the concluding pages of <bop>Dan Brown<eop>'s international bestseller The Da Vinci Code. The protagonist of <bop>his<eop> novel, Robert Langdon, reads esoteric symbolism into the two pyramids:
False	During her time at UMass Amherst, she has taught numerous students who would become notable linguists including Gennaro Chierchia and Irene Heim. Through her interactions with the philosopher and logician <bop>Richard Montague<eop> at UCLA in the 1970s she played an important role in bringing together the research traditions of generative linguistics, formal logic, and analytic philosophy, pursuing an agenda pioneered by David Lewis in <bop>his<eop> 1970 article General Semantics.

Peeta, Johanna Mason, Annie Cresta, and Enobaria, fellow Games victors captured by the Capitol, are to be granted immunity. <bop>Katniss<eop> also demands the privilege of killing Snow, but Coin only agrees to flip for the honor. For <bop>her<eop> sake, a rescue mission is mounted that succeeds in rescuing Peeta, Johanna and Annie.
False	Neither Alec nor his brother ever married. They lived together in Woking until Eric's death in 2006. Sir Alec Bedser died in hospital in Woking on 4 April 2010 after a short illness. Among those to pay tribute to the more famous of the two brothers was former Prime Minister and well-known cricket lover <bop>John Major<eop>, who said: ``Alec Bedser was one of the greatest medium-fast bowlers of all time. <bop>He<eop> was also one of the great thinkers about cricket and his wisdom was one of the great untapped resources of the modern game.''
True	Kolenkhov brings up that the Romans' hobby was wrestling, and demonstrates on Mr. Kirby by throwing him on the floor. To pass the time after the awkward incident, Penny suggests they play a free association game. <bop>Alice<eop> imagines what is coming and immediately tries to quash the suggestions, but Penny shrugs <bop>her<eop> off and instructs everyone to write down ``the first thing that pops into their heads'' after she says certain words.
False	Essie is married to Ed Carmichael, a xylophone player who lives with them and helps distribute Essie's candies. Ed is an amateur printer who prints any phrase that sounds catchy. Paul and <bop>Penny<eop>'s other daughter Alice Sycamore is quite obviously the only ``normal'' family member. <bop>She<eop> has an office job and is sometimes embarrassed by the eccentricities of her family, yet deep down, she still loves them.
False	She is an extremely prim and proper woman and is horrified by the goings-on in the Sycamore household. Her hobby is spiritualism. G-Man 1 (The Man), G-Man 2 (Jim), <bop>G-Man<eop> 3 (Mac) Three agents who come to investigate Ed because of the communist quotes <bop>he<eop> prints up and places in Essie's candy boxes, such as ``God is the State -- the State is God''.
False	After a back and forth game, the score was tied 0--0 at full-time, and remained so after extra time, leading to a penalty kick shootout. With <bop>Briana Scurry<eop>'s save of China's third kick, the score was 4--4 with only Brandi Chastain left to shoot. <bop>She<eop> scored and won the game for the United States.
False	Peary's team was also far more experienced in the ancient art of dog sledging. Peary's exploits and life were portrayed in the 1998 TV movie Glory & Honor. <bop>Henry Czerny<eop> played Robert Peary. <bop>His<eop> associate Matthew Henson was played by Delroy Lindo.
True	The Council of Mantua of 1459, or Congress of Mantua, was a religious meeting convoked by <bop>Pope Pius II<eop>, who had been elected to the Papacy in the previous year and was engaged in planning war against the Ottoman Turks, who had taken Constantinople in 1453. <bop>His<eop> call went out to the rulers of Europe, in an agonized plea to turn from internecine warfare to face Christendom's common enemy.
True	Torn - Torn is the Underground's second in command in Jak II and a Freedom League General in the war in Jak 3. In Jak II, Torn frequently sends <bop>Jak<eop> on missions to uncover information on the city, or more often than not, to carry out strikes on the Baron's forces. As an ex-Krimzon Guard of high authority <bop>he<eop> has witnessed the Baron's evil deeds.
True	One of the most well-known studies to demonstrate this was led by Sara Lazar, from Harvard University, in 2000. <bop>Richard Davidson<eop>, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, has led experiments in cooperation with the Dalai Lama on effects of meditation on the brain. <bop>His<eop> results suggest that long-term or short-term practice of meditation results in different levels of activity in brain regions associated with such qualities as attention, anxiety, depression, fear, anger, the ability of the body to heal itself.
False	She kept her head down, tried to make amends with her friends and steered clear of men but she wasn't alone for long. When she met police officer Martin Crowe at a kid's judo class, Louise felt a frisson of attraction. They became friends and after a while, romance blossomed. However, Louise was taking on Martin's daughter, <bop>Kayleigh<eop>, too. As <bop>she<eop> didn't have children, Louise didn't know how to behave around Kayleigh -- who worshipped her from the start.

False	Christian Frei set out with his camera to explore the current situation in Cuba, the result being a documentary that is sustained by powerful images, that testifies to technical skill, a professional way of dealing with the material and, most importantly, a carefully deduced and clear message: the two protagonists, Ricardo and Miriam, reflect the tension between a revolution that has already turned into history and the present that in fact seems to be taking place elsewhere. The Swiss film critic <bop>Norbert Creutz<eop> has estimated the objectivity and the formal quality of the film: In keeping <bop>his<eop> distance and seeking greater objectivity, Frei highlights contradictions and paradoxes while being careful to avoid taking sides.
False	After successfully organizing the murder of the Catalan commander <bop>Roger de Flor<eop> in an elaborate plot, Michael IX led the Byzantine troops (augmented by Turks and 5--8,000 Alans) against the furious Catalans (who swore revenge for the assassination of their commander), but was decisively defeated at the Battle of Apros. <bop>He<eop> was also heavily injured during that battle; a Catalan soldier named Bernad Ferrer seized him, whipped him and slashed his face.

True	He was originally determined to have died from 9/11 dust. However, the City medical examiner asserted that Zadroga died from self-injection of drugs.

False	The appeals court said that Whitman had based her information on contradictory information and statements from President Bush. The U.S. Department of Justice had argued that holding the agency liable would establish a risky legal precedent because future public officials would be afraid to make public statements. Judge <bop>Deborah Batts<eop> had previously declined to dismiss Whitman as a defendant, saying that <bop>her<eop> actions were ``conscience-shocking''.
False	Dalton noted flaws in the film but said that beside them, A Field in England is a rich, strange, hauntingly intense work from a highly original writer-director team.'' Peter Debruge of Variety called A Field in England ``a defiantly unclassifiable cross-genre experiment... that simultaneously reinvents and regurgitates low-budget British cinema as it goes''. <bop>Debruge<eop> said of the director's approach, ``Clearly, Wheatley is bored with the paint-by-numbers approach of <bop>his<eop> horror contemporaries, but has swung so far in the opposite direction here, the result feels almost amateurishly avant garde at times, guilty of the sort of indulgences one barely tolerates in student films.''
True	He began formal training at the age of 9 where he studied at Norma's Academy of Dance under the direction of the late Norma B. Mitchell and her daughter Djana Bell.

False	Nonetheless, the problems began when the leaders could not agree where the center of power of this union would be located. Many of the leaders would soon figure that this union would not happen, and many (such as <bop>Jos* de San Mart*n<eop>) went back to their regular lives in disappointment. Yet, in order to expand <bop>his<eop> personal dream of Gran Colombia, Bol*var allowed Sucre to form the nation of Bolivia in Upper Peru.

True	She goes on to acknowledge that in Finch's work, ``Now and again words issue of pure poetry...It was a thousand pities that the woman who could write like that, whose mind was turned to nature, and reflection, should have been forced to anger and bitterness.'' Woolf goes on in defence of her as a gifted but sometimes understandably misguided example of women's writing. It is evident that <bop>Woolf<eop> sympathises deeply with Finch's plight as a female poet, and though <bop>she<eop> takes issue with some of the content in Finch's writing, she expresses grief that Finch is so unknown: ``...when one comes to seek out the facts about Lady Winchilsea, one finds, as usual, that almost nothing is known about her.''

True	In 1800, whilst still a probationary student in his first year, Westall was approached by Sir Joseph Banks to serve as landscape and figure painter to a voyage of exploration under Matthew Flinders. The position had first been offered to Julius Caesar Ibbetson, who declined; and then William Daniell, but accepted but subsequently pulled out. Daniell was a fellow student of Westall, and was engaged to one of Westall's stepsisters, so it seems likely that <bop>Westall<eop> prevailed upon Daniell to recommend <bop>him<eop> as his replacement; however one source states that Westall was recommended by Benjamin West, President of the Royal Academy.
False	On 9 December 2010 Fern*ndez was questioned as a witness in relation to Operation Galgo, an investigation into a Spanish athletics doping ring being carried out by the Guardia Civil.

False	Most notable, however, is Brynner's first film role; he plays Vicola with sleek menace and self-assured evil (and with a full head of hair, too, I might add).

Film critic <bop>Dennis Schwartz<eop> gave the film a mixed review, writing, ``An unknown Yul Brynner, with all <bop>his<eop> hair, in his first film role, plays a well-spoken, smug narcotics smuggler named Paul Vicola.

False	But the Jewish men of letters who lived in Alexandria were by no means satisfied with the idea that Moses acquired the wisdom of the Egyptians; they claimed for him the merit of having given to Egypt, Phoenicia, and Hellas all their culture. He taught the Jews the letters, and they then became the teachers of the Phoenicians and, indirectly, of the Greeks, says Eupolemus. Artapanus of Alexandria, in <bop>his<eop> history of the Jews, went so far as to identify <bop>Moses<eop> with Tot-Hermes (the Egyptian messenger and scribe of the gods, who invented the letters, the various arts of peace and of war, as well as philosophy), and with the Greek Musaeus, ``the teacher of Orpheus.''

The latter informed the voters that <bop>he<eop> did not think himself qualified to represent them in Parliament, but he would ``at least give them an honest vote'' (in the House).

False	This myth of the city's origin was significant in ancient Roman mythology because Pallantium became one of the cities that was merged later into ancient Rome, thereby tying Rome's origins to the ancient Greek heroes.

True	Fresh confusion, climax of Isabella's despair: suddenly from the back is heard Brighella's burlesque cry for help; himself entangled in the coils of jealousy, he has seized the disguised State-holder by mistake, and thus leads to the latter's discovery. Friedrich is unmasked; Marianne, clinging to his side, is recognised. Amazement, indignation, joy: the necessary explanations are soon got through ; <bop>Friedrich<eop> moodily asks to be led before the judgment-seat of the King on <bop>his<eop> return, to receive the capital sentence;
False	For the latter Luzio lies in wait: he soon detects him in a stealthy masker, whose path he bars, and as Friedrich tears himself away he is about to follow him with shouts and drawn rapier, when by direction of Isabella, concealed among the bushes, he himself is stopped and led astray. <bop>Isabella<eop> comes forth, rejoicing in the thought of having restored Marianne to <bop>her<eop> faithless mate at this very moment, and in the possession of what she believes to be the stipulated patent of her brother's pardon; she is on the point of renouncing all further revenge when, breaking open the seal by the light of a torch, she is horrified at discovering an aggravation of the order of execution, which chance and bribery of the gaoler had delivered into her hands through her wish to defer her brother's knowledge of his ransom.

True	He used a traditional guitar style to play modern-based compositions in an extended way. And his liner notes were way cool. ' The press garnered by Death Chants was enough to get Fahey his first paying gig--a weeklong engagement at Boston's Odyssey Coffeehouse in the summer of '65.'' In <bop>his<eop> 1992 article ``Reinventing the Steel'' for Acoustic Guitar, <bop>Dale Miller<eop> described the liner notes that Fahey began including on his releases as ``hilarious yet profound and somewhat disturbing phony folklorical ramblings that spoofed the pedantic notes on many folk releases of the day.''
False	Hardy Har Har, Atom Ant, Squiddly Diddly, Top Cat, Benny the Ball, and Yakky Doodle are voiced by John Stephenson, Don Messick, Daws Butler, and Walker Edmiston here. It was presumed that Mel Blanc, Paul Frees, Howard Morris, Arnold Stang and Jimmy Weldon weren't available to voice them for this TV movie, while <bop>Benny<eop>'s voice actor Maurice Gosfield had died in 1964.

Along with <bop>his<eop> 31 stolen bases, <bop>Braun<eop> became only the 2nd Brewer ever to have a 30-homer, 30-steal season, joining Tommy Harper, who accomplished the feat in 1970.

False	Though as the writing of the libretto progressed, certain versions showed Grimes' relations with his apprentice to be paederastic, Pears persuaded Slater to cut the questionable stanzas from the final version.

False	Francis I of France restored its usual name early in the 16th century and it then took the nickname ``le bistourn*'' (``the twice-turned (church)''), later bowdlerised into ``le bestourn*'', possibly to bring it back closer to its old name. One of the church's chaplains was Guillaume de Villon, tutor to <bop>Fran*ois Villon<eop>, and Charles Perrault was buried in the church.

True	This was done in-order to reach the international community without much problem, as most of the TYO members were born and bred there.

True	He did not make his first official first team appearance for Shelbourne until August 15, 2005 where he made his debut coming on as a 2nd half substitute during a 1-0 defeat to Cork City at Turner's Cross.

False	Based on the historical findings of the Terman study and on biographical examples such as <bop>Richard Feynman<eop>, who had an IQ of 125 and went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics and become widely known as a genius, the current view of psychologists and other scholars of genius is that a minimum level of IQ, no lower than about IQ 125, is strictly necessary for genius; but that level of IQ is sufficient for development of genius only when combined with the other influences identified by Cox's biographical study: opportunity for talent development along with the characteristics of drive and persistence. Charles Spearman, bearing in mind the influential theory that <bop>he<eop> originated of conceiving intelligence as made up of a ``general factor'' as well as ``special factors'' more specific to particular mental tasks, may have summed up the research the best when he wrote in 1927, ``Every normal man, woman, and child is, then, a genius at something, as well as an idiot at something.''

True	Upon <bop>her<eop> retirement as its London Advisor, the Felton Bequest commissioned from John Brack a portrait of <bop>Ursula Hoff<eop>, which it then donated to the National Gallery of Victoria.
False	As with most major gods and goddesses in Roman mythology, the literary concept of Venus is mantled in whole-cloth borrowings from the literary Greek mythology of her counterpart, Aphrodite. In some Latin mythology Cupid was the son of Venus and Mars, the god of war. At other times, or in parallel myths and theologies, Venus was understood to be the consort of Vulcan. Virgil, in compliment to <bop>his<eop> patron <bop>Augustus<eop> and the gens Julia, embellished an existing connection between Venus, whom Julius Caesar had adopted as his protectress, and Aeneas.
False	In 1977, Ellis came out of retirement to play for Canada at the world hockey championships and then decided to resume his NHL career with the Leafs in 1977--78. <bop>Punch Imlach<eop> was hired to run the Leafs for the 1979--80 season and didn't feel that Ellis was worth the money <bop>he<eop> was being paid.
False	After being the league's top scorer with <bop>SV Leo Victor<eop> with 14 goals during the 2010-2011 season, Rijssel was offered a two-week trial with Belgium's Germinal Beerschot but ultimately was not signed by the club. It was reported that Rijssel made a favorable impression with the club, particularly with <bop>his<eop> ability to adapt to the difference in the level of play between the Suriname league and the Belgian league over the two-week period, but was unable to set himself apart from the attackers already on the roster, particularly considering the poor financial situation of the club at the time.
False	The Pharisee and the Publican, baroque fresco in Ottobeuren Basilica. The parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (or the Pharisee and the Tax Collector) is a parable of <bop>Jesus<eop> that appears in the Gospel of Luke. In Luke 18:9-14, a Pharisee, obsessed by <bop>his<eop> own virtue, is contrasted with a tax collector who humbly asks God for mercy.
True	Despenser's ruthless expansion of the de Clare lordship of Glamorgan in Wales led directly to the troubles of Edward II's later reign, including a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, the defeat of the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and eventually the deposition of the king by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella in 1326. Gilbert de Clare was the son of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester, -- known as <bop>Gilbert<eop> 'the Red' -- who in 1290 married Joan of Acre, daughter of Edward I. As a condition for the marriage, the earl had to surrender all <bop>his<eop> lands to the king, only to have them returned jointly to himself and his wife for the lifetime of either.
True	Donaldson disputed the CWT fuel-air vapor explosion scenario, stating that ``In the history of aviation, there has never been an in-flight explosion in any Boeing airliner of a Jet-A kerosene fuel vapor/air mixture in any tank, caused by mechanical failure.'' Eyewitness, debris field, metallurgical, and victim injury evidence were all cited by Donaldson as proof of the missile-attack scenario. <bop>Donaldson<eop> acknowledged James Sanders' theory of an accidental shoot-down, and did not rule out U.S. Navy involvement; however, <bop>he<eop> viewed circumstantial evidence of a terrorist attack ``more compelling''.
False	Many months later, when Epic was preparing a ``Greatest Hits'' album, they had eleven cuts and asked Bobby what should be the twelfth; ``Mr. Lonely'' was his response to the question. Following its inclusion, many disc jockeys started to play it - particularly those who remembered <bop>Buddy Greco<eop>'s version and how Epic had shortchanged Bobby on <bop>his<eop> own song.
True	He is also especially the one to tell Donald of the work Chinese immigrants put into building the Central Pacific Railroad. This information intrigues Donald and from that moment he begins to have dreams of helping to build the railroad as a Chinese immigrant. <bop>Larry Louie<eop> is Donald's dance instructor. <bop>He<eop> is also known as ``The Chinese Fred Astaire.''
False	Designed in the grand Victorian style, this imposing red brick building with stucco ornaments was for many years a ``rough Irish pub'' until its gentrification in the early 2000s. In the 1980s the Princess Victoria was briefly owned by <bop>Richard Branson<eop> and run as a music venue, with singer Phil Collins filming the music videos for <bop>his<eop> songs Sussudio and One more Night on the premises.
True	His guest-starring appearance on Cimarron City led him to his starring in his own series later that year, Laramie, one of the few network television programs set in Wyoming. <bop>Patrick Kelly<eop> called Fuller to <bop>his<eop> office, that a young, unfamiliar actor realized he had done something wrong, knowing he'd be fired.
False	The new court was moved first to Neuburg, then to Heidelberg, and finally to Mannheim. The D*sseldorf court orchestra was dissolved in the process, but in 1718, many of its musicians were reinstated in the Innsbruck court orchestra headed by Greber. In 1723, after Charles Philip moved <bop>his<eop> court to Mannheim, <bop>Johann von Wilderer<eop> was appointed to serve jointly with Greber as Kapellmeister.

False	Walsmear's only reason for proving to himself that the fairies were real, was to assuage his conscience -- to convince himself that she died as a result of seeing fairies, as opposed to her committing suicide from guilt as a result of her having an affair with Walsmear. Castle's interest in the fairies, by this time, was purely self-serving; he fancied he had made an amazing discovery in the garden and prepared to take some photographs of the garden at night, using special lighting techniques. On <bop>his<eop> way to the garden the next night, however, Castle once again ran into <bop>Paolo<eop> and Shorty, whom Walsmear hired to steal the photographs from the Templeton house.
False	Thomas continued in the Army until January 1824 when he sold out his commission. He settled on land he named ``Dagworth'' (after the farm where he was born), an estate of 2,000 acres (8.1 km*) on the Hunter River, granted to him on 21 April 1825. In a letter to <bop>her<eop> niece, <bop>Louisa<eop>, dated 2 June 1825, Thomas'' wife Christiana describes her husband: ``Uncle Thomas has very dark hair, a high forehead, dark blue eyes, rather a short nose, a small mouth with a fine set of very white teeth, which he shows very much when he laughs; a very black beard, and nice black whiskers.
False	In the 2006 European Championships in Athletics, O'Rourke finished joint second with Kirsten Bolm and behind Swedish athlete and favourite, Susanna Kallur in a time of 12.72, a new national record.

True	When Mashiro was feeling depressed due to Takumi's words, Chie suggested to Aoi to bring in Arika to cheer her up which works and pulls both out of their depression. <bop>Chie<eop> was also aware that Tomoe Marguerite was involved in numerous plots to take out Arika Yumemiya but rather than report Tomoe <bop>she<eop> orders her to stop it.
False	He marched on Wareham, the port used by Matilda's party to maintain communications with Normandy. Wareham was too strongly defended for the king to capture, so he turned towards Salisbury instead. On his way there, he occupied Wilton Abbey while waiting for reinforcements from Winchester. While King Stephen was stationed at Wilton, mustering <bop>his<eop> forces for an attack on Salisbury, <bop>Earl Robert<eop> mounted a surprise attack at sunset on 1 July 1143. Stephen attempted to break out from the siege, but his army was forced back and dispersed by a cavalry charge from Earl Robert's army.
False	Mabern learned by watching and emulating pianists Charles Thomas and Phineas Newborn, Jr. Mabern attended Douglass High School, before transferring to Manassas High School; he played with Frank Strozier, George Coleman and <bop>Booker Little<eop> at this time, but was most influenced by Newborn, Jr. In 1954, after graduating, Mabern moved to Chicago, intending to attend the American Conservatory of Music. <bop>He<eop> was unable to afford to attend music college because of a change in his parents' financial circumstances, but had private lessons there for six months and developed his reading ability by playing with trombonist Morris Ellis' big band.

He was 5.17 seconds behind the heat winner, <bop>Matzinger<eop>, and 3.56 seconds behind the second-last finisher, Russian Alexey Kotlov. Lopes Cardoso's was the slowest overall in the heat round and <bop>he<eop> did not progress to the final.
True	When the first governor-general, Timothy Michael Healy retired in December 1927, James McNeill was proposed as his replacement by the Irish government of W. T.

True	The jury was played a recording of Stewart's telephone call to the police in which he reported Bailey missing; when asked to describe her he could not recall the colour of her eyes, had to look up both her mobile phone number and date of birth, and was unable to give the address of their holiday home in Kent. Eileen Bailey (Helen's mother) testified that Helen had been concerned that she was sleeping excessively, and about her state of mind. The prosecution stated that traces of anti-insomnia medication had been found in Bailey's body. Giving evidence in <bop>his<eop> defence, <bop>Stewart<eop> claimed that Bailey and her dog had been kidnapped on 11 April 2016 by two men called Nick and Joe, saying that he had not told the police about this ``to keep Helen safe'' and that the kidnappers had demanded a ransom of *500,000.
True	He said that he had spoken to her for the last time on a mobile phone belonging to one of the men on 15 April.

False	All her force, and it is the more tremendous for being constricted, goes into the assertion, 'I love. I hate. I suffer. '''-- Virginia Woolf. The Daily Telegraph's, Lucy Hughes-Hallett argues that Villette is greater than Bront*'s most famous work <bop>Jane Eyre<eop>. <bop>She<eop> states that the novel is ``an astonishing piece of writing, a book in which phantasmagorical set pieces alternate with passages of minute psychological exploration, and in which Bront*'s marvellously flexible prose veers between sardonic wit and stream-of-consciousness, in which the syntax bends and flows and threatens to dissolve completely in the heat of madness, drug-induced hallucination and desperate desire.''
True	The audience feels the effects of the previous notes and can reflect on that moment intentionally. Silence does not hinder musical excellence but can enhance the sounds of instruments and vocals within the piece. In his book Sound and Silence (1970), the composer <bop>John Paynter<eop> says, ``the dramatic effect of silence has long been appreciated by composers.'' <bop>He<eop> gives as an example, ``the general pause in the middle of the chorus ``Have lightnings and thunders ...'' in Bach's St. Matthew Passion'':

False	Wilhelmina became Editor-in-Chief of Mode magazine, but that position would not last long, as she was demoted back to Creative Director after sales for the new Mode plunged, thanks in part to Alexis regaining her trust in Daniel and Betty discovering a series of letters Marc gave <bop>her<eop> on purpose after he felt betrayed by <bop>Wilhelmina<eop>'s ill-fated plan to mold Betty into the next ``Wilhelmina.''
False	After she witnesses Alexis and Daniel bury the hatchet, Wilhelmina realizes Alexis has turned on her: when Alexis tells her she is keeping Daniel on board as editor-in-chief, Wilhelmina ends their partnership and now regards Alexis as an enemy. When <bop>Wilhelmina<eop> later finds out that MODE legally belongs to Claire Meade, Bradford's wife, <bop>she<eop> visits her at the hospital where Claire is detoxing for her hearing.

Back home, Wilhelmina continues to secretly meet Connor in prison; the perks of having a Senator for a father granting her daily conjugal visits. Wilhelmina, however, pretends to <bop>Daniel<eop> that she is no longer interested in Connor but that if <bop>he<eop> re-instates her in her old capacity, she will retrieve the money from Connor, who is still in love with her.
True	In Plus None we find out that Nico didn't really kill her boyfriend, she is just trying to extort money from Wilhelmina, with her boyfriend posing as a private investigator blackmailing the Slaters. In desperation, Wilhelmina planned to flee the country with Nico, and resigned from her position at Mode effective after the upcoming ``Fearless shoot'' in the Bahamas. However, <bop>Marc<eop> later overheard Nico and her boyfriend scheming, and after initially refusing to believe <bop>him<eop>, Wilhelmina set a trap for Nico by showing her an expensive family heirloom that they could use to pay off the blackmailer.
True	Sir Alan built St Fillan's Church, which still stands, next to the castle, in around 1140, and his family probably built the original hall house in around 1200, or possibly even earlier. In 1216, another Alan de Mortimer is recorded granting land to the monks of Inchcolm Abbey. There is no record of what happened to the de Mortimers, but in the early 14th century, <bop>King Robert<eop> the Bruce granted Aberdour to <bop>his<eop> kinsman, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray (d. 1332).

False	The book itself does not identify which stories were written by whom, and although Bethan would have been happy to put her name to her work, not all the contributors were willing to do so.

False	Heard was the first among a group of literati friends (several others of whom, including Christopher Isherwood, were also British) to discover Swami Prabhavananda and Vedanta.

Their claim to two parts of the church of St. Andrew, Market Stainton, involved them in a struggle with <bop>Robert Grosteste<eop>, bishop of Lincoln, in the reign of Henry III. <bop>He<eop> revoked the appropriation made by his predecessor, but in 1245 the priory's appeal to Pope Innocent IV was finally successful.
False	The move was immediately denied by the NHL for obvious reasons; Wolfe had long retired from the NHL and was well into his career as a financial planner in the Washington, D.C. -metropolitan area. <bop>Phil Esposito<eop>, who had recently become part owner of the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning was quoted as saying about the incident: ``I didn't just pay $50 million for Bernie Wolfe. <bop>He<eop> wasn't any good when I played against him''.

True	Touting the league's second-best defensive unit (behind only the reigning champion Seahawks), the Lions posted an 11--5 record and qualified for the playoffs.

While praising <bop>Wurtzel<eop>'s prose style as ``sparkling'' and ``luminescent,'' Kakutani thought the memoir ``would have benefited enormously from some strict editing'' and said that its ``self-pitying passages make the reader want to shake the author, and remind <bop>her<eop> that there are far worse fates than growing up during the '70s in New York and going to Harvard.''

False	Especially in South America, he was criticised for conservative bias in his appointments of bishops; with an unusually long reign of over 25 years, the majority of bishops in place at his death had been appointed by him.

False	And the Lord said to him, ``How can you say, 'I have fulfilled the Law and the Prophets', when it is written in the Law: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself', and many of your brothers, sons of <bop>Abraham<eop>, are covered with filth, dying of hunger, and your house is full of many good things, none of which goes out to them?'' And <bop>he<eop> (Jesus) turned and said to Simon his disciple, who was sitting by him, ``Simon son of John, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.''(
False	Traditionally he led the Church from Jerusalem and according to 1 Corinthians (15:7) had a special appearance of the resurrected Jesus, and only ``then to all the apostles''. Concerning its origin, Jerome relates that the Nazarenes believed that the Hebrew Gospel he received while at Chalcis was written by <bop>Matthew the Evangelist<eop>. In <bop>his<eop> work On Illustrious Men, Jerome explains that Matthew, also called Levi, composed a gospel of Christ, which was first published in Judea in Hebrew script for the sake of those of the circumcision who believed (On Illustrious Men, 2) Meanwhile, in his Commentary on Matthew, Jerome refers to the Gospel of the Nazarenes and the Gospel of the Hebrews.
False	A notable theme running through his work (most notably the 'Dead' trilogy) is agalmatophilia c male lust for young female gynoid s, as well as the darker undercurrents of British national culture. His novels and stories have links and plot overlaps between one another, and together form a mythos. His ``epic masterpiece'' (``Reading <bop>Richard Calder<eop>'', Claude Lalumi*re) is said to be Malignos (2000). <bop>He<eop> cites as inspirations Angela Carter and Georges Bataille, among others.
True	Ted Danson ultimately won the role, but Dryer later appeared as sportscaster (and former Red Sox teammate of Sam's) Dave Richards in the episodes ``Sam at Eleven'', ``Old Flames'', ``Love Thy Neighbor'', and ``'I' On Sports''. <bop>Dryer<eop>'s best-known acting role came in the 1980s television crime drama Hunter, in which <bop>he<eop> costarred with Stepfanie Kramer.
False	Crime boss Rusty Pirone (Armand Assante) is about to stand trial again and Daniel Graham (Gabriel Byrne) of the district attorney's office is determined this time to put him behind bars. Pirone sends one of his henchmen, a burned-out ex-cop named Tommy Vesey (William Hurt), to threaten Valerie Alston (<bop>Joanne Whalley-Kilmer<eop>), a juror. Unless <bop>she<eop> cooperates by finding Pirone innocent and deadlocking the jury, Vesey intends to do harm to Valerie's young son.

He has been a director at the Australian Swim Coaches Association since 1989 and at the Doug Frost Swim School since 1978. After <bop>Thorpe<eop> controversially changed coaches, Frost left the Sutherland club to start afresh in Southport, Queensland. In May 2005, <bop>he<eop> was appointed the head coach of the swimming program at the Australian Institute of Sport.

Codey<eop> as acting Governor of New Jersey, Paul was asked to serve as Codey's Chief Counsel and provide legal counsel to, and representation for, the Governor of the State of New Jersey on a daily basis pertaining to issues involving all aspects of state governance.
True	Sternschnuppen (Shooting stars), WAB 73, is a song, which Anton Bruckner composed for his own men's voice quartet in c. 1848 during his stay in the Sankt Florian. <bop>Bruckner<eop> composed the song on a text of Ernst Marinelli in c. 1848. <bop>He<eop> dedicated it to his own men's voice quartet, which was composed of Ludwig Ehrenecker, Franz Sch*fler, Johann Nepomuk Hueber and himself.
True	In the final she fell to Johanna Larsson of Sweden in three sets: 6--1, 1--6, 6--3. She ended the year with a singles record of 20--21 and a year-end ranking of 160. In doubles, <bop>South<eop> captured two titles in Helsinki and Glasgow partnering Emma Laine for both titles. <bop>She<eop> also achieved a first round win over Alona Bondarenko and Kateryna Bondarenko at Wimbledon, alongside fellow Brit Jocelyn Rae.
False	His favourite pastime is playing the ``House Rules Parcheesi'', a game which has many, very complicated rules, that is claimed to be rather opposite to Calvinball. Llewellyn married Millie's Mother at the end of the Daily Strip. Of all the characters in Ozy and <bop>Millie<eop>, Simpson has claimed that Llewellyn is <bop>her<eop> favorite.
True	Jenkins then joined the Reform Party, but Endean was selected as the party's candidate instead. Endean represented the Auckland electorates of Parnell from 1930 to 1938, and then Remuera from 1938 to 1943. When the Reform Party merged with United to form the National Party in 1936, <bop>Endean<eop> became a National Party member. <bop>He<eop> was controversial within the National Party and in the party's 50-year history written by Barry Gustafson, it is remarked that in 1938, there was ``some resistance to the National MP'' in the Remuera electorate.
False	Kenya started off solidly in their big chase, with openers Morris Ouma and Seren Waters adding 37 for the first wicket until a direct hit from Umar Akmal had the latter run out. The Kenyans fought during the first half of their innings, getting to 73/2 before <bop>Shahid Afridi<eop> bowled Steve Tikolo. <bop>He<eop> then ran through the lower middle order and the tail with ease, and ended up with figures of 5/16 from 8 overs as Kenya collapsed to 112 all out, with the only resistance offered by Collins Obuya's 47.
False	On one hand, it is possible that, following William's death, Hagrold seized control of parts of the Cotentin with foreign support, and extended his authority to Bayeux. On the other hand, Hagrold may have operated in the context of aiding the Normans of Rouen to oppose the Franks. Although he likely defended Bayeux from Louis and <bop>Hugh<eop> in 944, Hagrold's capture of Louis the following years suggests that <bop>he<eop> volunteered to assist Hugh against the king.
False	Ferrari also cast doubt on ``the arrival of technicians'' with Alonso. At the first race in Bahrain, Alonso qualified third behind team mate Massa and pole sitter Sebastian Vettel. At the start, Alonso got ahead of Massa to move up to second and later on in the race, leader <bop>Vettel<eop> had an engine problem and dropped to fourth and Alonso won the race, becoming the fifth man to win on <bop>his<eop> debut for Ferrari after Juan Manuel Fangio in 1956, Mario Andretti in 1971, Nigel Mansell in 1989, and Kimi R*ikk*nen in 2007.
True	Sonny initially throws Claudia out after Ric suggests that he may be the baby's father, but Sonny eventually allows her to stay until the baby's paternity is confirmed. An amniocentesis later proves that the baby is Sonny's. On her way to tell him, <bop>Claudia<eop> is accidentally run off the road by Sonny's daughter Kristina Davis, and miscarries the baby. <bop>She<eop> contacts Jerry Jacks in the hospital to get him to track down Michael and Kristina, who ran away from home.
False	For the rest of his career, Norton continued to reside in Los Angeles and obtain small roles in films. Many films he appeared in are now considered to be classics. Norton was married to Josephine Byers, a woman from California by whom he had a daughter, <bop>Sharon<eop>, and two grandchildren. In <bop>her<eop> autobiography Being and Becoming, actress Myrna Loy wrote that she briefly dated Norton.
False	These feuilletons (nineteen of them) were then compiled into a book F*nf Minuten Amerika and published by Paul Zsolnay Verlag the next year, 1931. In his book, Salten provides subjective observations of American society and nature, and the main emphasis is on his personal impressions and opinions. He conversed with movie stars, society women, farmers, and fellow writers like <bop>Upton Sinclair<eop>. In <bop>his<eop> commentary, Salten is both admiring and critical.
False	He was the one in Sutton's car the night she drove into a lake. He is found dead the morning after Ethan and Sutton interrogate him about what happened. Sydney Barrosse as Phyllis Chamberlin (season 1), Char's mother and Rebecca's sister. She is an alcoholic. After <bop>she<eop> left <bop>Sutton<eop>'s birthday party drunk and got a DUI, Rebecca tells Alec to put Phyllis on mandatory lockdown at a rehab facility.
False	Janet believes Mike may be having an affair with his assistant, Claire Hackett (Maura McGiveney). Janet's beliefs are fueled by the Harpers' busybody landlady, Vanessa Courtwright (<bop>Hermione Baddeley<eop>), who thinks Janet can play Mike's game by entering into an affair of <bop>her<eop> own, whether it be real or made-up.
True	Hughes captained England for every one of Mercer's seven games in charge, and initially maintained the role when Don Revie was appointed as Ramsey's permanent successor. However, after the first two qualifiers for the 1976 European Championships, <bop>Revie<eop> decided to drop Hughes from the team. <bop>He<eop> gave the captaincy to his former Blackpool team-mate Alan Ball, and Hughes appeared only twice for England in 1975.
True	In 1793, the British transported him to New South Wales for life as punishment for a murder. The authorities in NSW executed Morgan for bashing Simon Raven to death in Sydney on 18 October 1796. On 30 November 1796, <bop>Morgan<eop> was hanged for the brutal murder of Simon Raven. Following <bop>his<eop> execution his body was hung in chains (gibbeting) on Pinchgut.
False	The other provinces did not recognize Lavalle as a legtimate governor, and supported the rosist resistance instead. Lavalle would be defeated a short time later at the Battle of M*rquez Bridge by the forces of Rosas and L*pez. L*pez returned to Santa Fe, which was menaced by <bop>Jos* Mar*a Paz<eop>, while Rosas kept Lavalle under siege and forced <bop>him<eop> to resign with the Ca*uelas pact.
True	In her 1958 novel about Alaska, Ice Palace, Edna Ferber based the character of Bridie Ballantyne, official greeter of the fictional town of Baranof, on McGown;, the part was played by Carolyn Jones in the 1960 film adaptation of the novel. <bop>McGown<eop> belonged to the Women Pioneers, Eastern Star, Salvation Army, Soroptimists, Fort Wainwright and Eielson Officers' Women's Clubs. <bop>She<eop> was a member of St. Matthew's Episcopal Church, where she played the organ and led the choir.

Jones and her brother Paul then rented an apartment together not far from their mother. Five and a half months later, in the early morning hours of August 28, 1976 after partying all night in the beach town of Oceanside, California with her new boyfriend Allan (Butch) Koven and others, <bop>Jones<eop> was found dead in the bedroom of a house belonging to the parents of a 14-year-old friend named Helen Hennessey. The coroner 's report listed <bop>her<eop> death as an accidental drug overdose.
False	However, the plan did not go through because Zhuge Liang, the Chancellor of Shu, rejected Wei Yan's plan. In 228, the second <bop>Wei<eop> emperor, Cao Rui, personally led reinforcements to Chang'an to defend against a series of invasions by Shu forces under Zhuge Liang's leadership. <bop>He<eop> removed Xiahou Mao from his command and reassigned to be a Master of Writing (**) in the Wei central government in Luoyang.
True	His father, the owner of an appliance store and record shop, exposed him as a young boy to prominent jazz musicians like King Oliver and Louis Armstrong, who inspired his 2014 release, Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch. Throughout his adolescence his father's connections enabled him access to the recording rooms of burgeoning rock artists such as Little Richard and Guitar Slim. From these exposures he advanced into clubs and onto the stage with varying local artists, most notably, Professor Longhair. When <bop>he<eop> was about 13 or 14 years old, <bop>Rebennack<eop> met Professor Longhair, which started a period in his life that would mark rapid growth as a musician and the beginnings of his entry into professional music.
False	1.68 22.3 The 2006--07 campaign marked Cappie Pondexter's first campaign in Europe. She was a major contributor to the success of the Fenerbah*e Istanbul club. When <bop>her<eop> side's quarter-final match-up against <bop>Ros Casares<eop> was tied at 67, Pondexter scored the winning basket with just seconds remaining to lift Fenerbah*e to victory.
False	Yankees fan blogs, which generally bemoan the team's relief pitchers, quickly grew frustrated with the team's reluctance to place Britton on the major league roster, or use him when available. This unwillingness to use the pitcher has been dubbed ``Brittongate.'' General manager <bop>Brian Cashman<eop> expressed confidence in Britton: ``<bop>He<eop> has not failed in any capacity at any level.
True	Loretta manages to convince Steph and Frankie that Jake has been threatening her and she is afraid of him. Jake feels he has no choice but to stay with Loretta or his family will have him sectioned again. He confides in Nancy, who privately meets Adam to confirm Jake's story. When <bop>Nancy<eop> is alone, Loretta confronts <bop>her<eop> and Nancy is accidentally injured.
True	Jake feels he has no choice but to stay with Loretta or his family will have him sectioned again. He confides in Nancy, who privately meets Adam to confirm Jake's story. When Nancy is alone, Loretta confronts her and Nancy is accidentally injured. Jake shows up and <bop>Loretta<eop> holds Nancy hostage before revealing that <bop>she<eop> had been sexually abused as a child and no one had believed her.
True	She took over the role of Pippa Fletcher from Vanessa Downing on 23 July 1990 and continued to play the part on Home and Away until leaving in 1998, although she has frequently returned to guest star. This character was widely popular and continues to be a favourite. <bop>Debra Lawrance<eop> is well known for playing Lisa Cook in Sons and Daughters between 1983 and 1984 and inmate Daphne Graham in Prisoner from 1985 to 1986 and,much earlier in the series <bop>she<eop> had guest roles as a Nurse and Trainee Prisoner Officer Sally Dean.
False	It seems clear that they have not spoken for quite some time, and Esme is so glad to finally see her daughter again that she begins to weep as she hugs Amy. Once she has recovered, we learn that Esme has been acting as a nurse on a television show, and that Frank had been trying to marry Esme practically since the last time Amy had visited. <bop>Esme<eop> knows why Amy has come though, as <bop>her<eop> marital scandals have been all over the news since Dominic is now a ``media monolith.''
False	Amy arrives at the house looking for Esme to find Frank poring over various books and documents, Evelyn sleeping across the room in a wheelchair. Esme arrives not long after Amy, but is surprised to see her. It seems clear that they have not spoken for quite some time, and Esme is so glad to finally see her daughter again that she begins to weep as she hugs <bop>Amy<eop>. Once <bop>she<eop> has recovered, we learn that Esme has been acting as a nurse on a television show, and that Frank had been trying to marry Esme practically since the last time Amy had visited.
True	I'm frightened of you because you're the past.'' Act four is set in 1995, and is set backstage, in a dressing room of a small West end theater. A young actor, <bop>Toby<eop>, comes in, speaking with Esme about the play as she begins to ready for the next show. When <bop>he<eop> leaves to get Esme a cappuccino, Dominic wanders into the dressing room.
False	On request of England, the involved judges were recalled to the Netherlands and put on trial, but were finally (in 1632) judged to have acted lawfully. Decades later, <bop>Oliver Cromwell<eop> used embellished versions of this event, dubbed the ``Amboyna massacre'', as one of the pretexts to start both the First Anglo-Dutch war (in 1652) and the Second Anglo-Dutch War (in 1665), while John Dryden produced <bop>his<eop> tragedy Amboyna; or the Cruelties of the Dutch to the English Merchants on request of one of the English negotiators of the Secret Treaty of Dover during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.
False	For his work at the Army War College, Clarke was awarded the General Dwight D. Eisenhower Chair in National Security in 1994. In 1995, following 30-years on active duty, Clarke retired.

Following <bop>his<eop> retirement from the Army, Clarke was the Training Manager at the Royal Saudi Land Forces Armored Institute in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia training Saudi armor officers and soldiers on the M1A2 main battle tank.
False	The magazine also listed Pam Bouvier seventh on their list of worst Bond girls, saying Carey Lowell ``fumbled this attempt at giving 007 a modern, independent counterpart by turning her into a nagging pest.'' <bop>Norman Wilner<eop> of MSN considered Licence to Kill the second worst Bond film, above only A View to a Kill, but defended Dalton, saying <bop>he<eop> ``got a raw deal.
False	Licence to Kill is one of the best of the recent Bonds.'' Jack Kroll, writing in Newsweek described Licence to Kill as ``a pure, rousingly entertaining action movie''. Kroll was mixed in his appraisal of Dalton, calling him ``a fine actor who hasn't yet stamped Bond with <bop>his<eop> own personality'', observing ``Director <bop>John Glen<eop> is the Busby Berkeley of action flicks, and his chorus line is the legendary team of Bond stunt-persons who are at their death-defying best here''.
False	At Wimbledon, she cruised into the fourth round but was upset by Coco Vandeweghe in straight set. She then lost to Petra Kvitov* in the final at New Haven. After suffering a first round loss at the US Open to <bop>Lesia Tsurenko<eop>, it was revealed that *af**ov* was suffering from an abdominal muscle tear and a bacterial infection. <bop>She<eop> missed the Asian swing as a result and in her first match back in Linz, she lost to Andreea Mitu in straight sets.

False	There, he performed in a workshop production of Colleen Murphy's The Piper (with future film star Rachel McAdams) and studied under David Rotenberg, David Smukler and Dean Gilmour, among others. As a second year thesis assignment, Kelly created a play that would eventually become The Anorak, his critically acclaimed one-man-show about the *cole Polytechnique massacre and the life and death of <bop>Marc L*pine<eop>. Upon completion of <bop>his<eop> M.FA in Acting, Kelly was given the title role in Necessary Angel's main-stage production of The Piper at the Factory Theatre.
True	Ussher brought Redwing to anchor within point-blank range of the battery, using her broadsides to silence its guns. A cutting-out party under Lieutenant Ferguson then destroyed the mistico and extracted the feluccas. <bop>Ussher<eop> and Ferguson, with a landing party of 40 men, then captured the battery and spiked its guns. This, and <bop>his<eop> previous actions, led to Ussher's promotion to post captain.
True	In 1965, the Cook sisters were honored as Righteous Gentiles by the Yad Vashem Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Authority in Israel.

False	No contemporary source states which of Brankovi*'s five children were also Irene's, although the youngest, Catherine, bore the name of Kantakouzenos, and Mara was ``clearly'' the daughter of one of Brankovi*'s earlier wives. Based on portraits of <bop>Irene<eop> with *ura* Brankovi* and his five children from a chrysobull preserved at the monastery of Esphigmenou on Mount Athos, dated 11 September 1429, Nicol interprets how the individuals were grouped that Stefan and Lazar were <bop>her<eop> children too.

False	He became head of the Department of Anthropology at Mexico City College, which position he held at the time of his passing on January 2, 1951. According to fellow anthropologist <bop>Charles E. Dibble<eop>, ``In the brief span of a decade, Barlow gave Middle American research an impetus and perspective of enduring consequence. <bop>His<eop> contributions in Mexican archaeology, classical and modern Nahuatl, Mexican colonial history, and what he preferred to call ''Bilderhandschriften`` are of lasting importance.''

False	Cheryl is allowed out of hospital for a day visit and comes face to face with Marlene (who had purchased Number 24 from Madge Bishop (Anne Charleston)) after more than a quarter century. The meeting between the two women is frosty to begin with but Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies) convinces <bop>Cheryl<eop> to make up with Marlene, as <bop>she<eop> never had the chance to make up with her mother, Fiona (Suzanne Dudley) before she died.
False	Cheryl was born to Hector and Marlene Kratz (Moya O'Sullivan) in 1950. When Cheryl was eleven years old, Marlene left Hector to raise her and her brother, Patrick (Shane Porteous). <bop>Cheryl<eop> then grew up hating and resenting Marlene, even believing <bop>her<eop> to be dead.
False	She's a mum first and foremost and she's got her identity from being a mum. (...) She's a quiet person. (...) She's strong and she's way classier than I'll ever be!'' Gabby is also portrayed as being ``quiet''. In the same interview, <bop>Oruche<eop> noted the differences between Gabby and <bop>her<eop> character Liberty Baker in Footballers Wives.
False	Phil then leaves alone. Gabby tries to reason with Amber but she ignores her. Gabby meets Cindy Hutchinson (Stephanie Waring) at Cincerity boutique and they become friends.

False	In 2016 Wellington artist Erica van Zon produced a body of work in homage to Hitchings, titled Coffee Perhaps. The work was displayed at The Dowse Art Museum. The archives of the Helen Hitchings Gallery are held in the Te Papa archives. <bop>Justine Olsen<eop>, curator of Decorative and Applied Arts at Te Papa, was interviewed about Helen Hitchings and the influence of <bop>her<eop> gallery in 2015.
True	Previous to this she had worked as a theatre designer and advertising assistant.

However, Fukuyama Sakura left the group and Chen Qu replaced <bop>her<eop> on the performance.
False	She had retired following her role on The Edge of Night but she was coaxed out of retirement by soap opera writer and producer Agnes Nixon, who had created the role of ``Kate'' especially for Kay Campbell on the soap opera All My Children. Contrary to popular belief, she was the not the first actress to play the role. Kate Harrington originated the character, was recast with <bop>Christine Thomas<eop>, who was in turn recast with Campbell. <bop>She<eop> portrayed Kate Martin from mid-1970 to her death in 1985, from injuries resulting from an automobile accident.

True	In 1955 she added two roles to her Met repertoire: Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust with Thomas Hayward in the title role and Zdenka in Arabella with Eleanor Steber in the title role. After a two year absence from the Met, <bop>Fenn<eop> returned in April 1959 to portray Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus with Theodor Uppman as Eisenstein and Laurel Hurley as Adele. That role along with Mussetta became <bop>her<eop> bread and butter at the house.
False	Johnson's death in 1950 led to an internal disagreement over his role as a teacher chosen by God, and resulted in the formation of new splinter groups, such as the Epiphany Bible Students Association, and the Laodicean Home Missionary Movement. Johnson believed he had been appointed by <bop>God<eop> as Russell's official spiritual successor, that <bop>he<eop> was the last member of the 144,000 of Revelation 7, and that hope of a heavenly reward of immortality for the Christian faithful would cease after his death.
False	Ronald Mailhot was named interim principal at the end of 2011, following the retirement of former principal John R. Rist, but will now be returning as full-time principal in 2012. <bop>Mailhot<eop> later resigned in the middle of the 2013-2014 school year and was replaced by John Rist for <bop>his<eop> second stint as principal of Central.
False	Silk agrees to the bet and the two fought, he easily beats Tre, Tre recovers and ambushes Silk from behind with a piece of wood (while Silk goads Howard) causing Silk to fall and lose hold of his gun while being attacked, a curious Tammy rushes downstairs to find Silk on the floor, she defends him from Tre.

True	Potter was following the pattern of fairy tales by dwelling on the theme of pursuit and prey and, if there is a moral to Potter's interpretation of the theme, it tells us that an innocent, helpless, simple, or rash animal may become someone else's meal. Potter often pointed out that the tale of Jemima was a retelling of ``Little Red Riding Hood''.

False	Things go awry when Den discovers that Sharon and Dennis have resumed their affair, and in order to split them up, Den persuades Zoe to lie that she is pregnant with Dennis's baby.

All <bop>her<eop> novels take place within the same fictional world, often with fantasy plot-lines inspired by historical events.
False	The fact that Luna faced Mohs and McCarter, who, combined, averaged 16 and a half fights against Luna's relative inexperience, on her very first year as a boxer, might underline a problem in women's boxing in that many times, young, new women fighters are put against more seasoned opponents, potentially putting the younger boxer's life at risk. On April 4, 2003, she defeated Mohs in a rematch. once again held in Laughlin. On May 7, she met <bop>Jaqueline Nava<eop>, in what represented Luna's Las Vegas debut. <bop>She<eop> defeated Nava by a four round decision.

From the start the Social-Democratic party incorporated in its programme the ``equality of all rights''.

August <bop>Bebel<eop>'s book ``Die Frau und der Sozialismus'' went through fifty editions in 1879-1910, and was translated into fourteen languages. In this work the position of woman in the Socialistic state of the future is described.

False	True self-insertion is a literal and generally undisguised representation of the author; most characters described as ``Mary Sues'' are not, though they are often called ``proxies'' for the author.

Defeated by Governor Angeloz by over 15%, this latter setback was significant because it cost <bop>De la Sota<eop> much of <bop>his<eop> support within the Justicialist Party (which was flush with victory in the 1991 mid-terms), leading to President Carlos Menem 's endorsement of a separate party list in C*rdoba for the 1993 mid-term elections, and to De la Sota's failure to regain a seat in Congress.

True	Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani viewed the album as formulaic and ``competently, often frustratingly more of the same from an artist who still seems capable of much more.'' Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune perceived ``formula production and hack songwriting'', but complimented Pink's personality and its ``handful'' of worthy tracks.

True	Connie, in a one-sided conversation, gives praises for her late brother, Gordon.

Although Beth quietly agrees with <bop>Connie<eop>'s idea of <bop>her<eop> idyllic marriage to Gordon, she expresses subtle annoyance with Connie's idea that the whole family will have to look after her this first Christmas alone, and Connie's hints of self-pity don't help either.

Wallace, Sr., voted for Gurney and hence provided him a coalition of growing Republicans in Florida allied with a declining number of conservative Democrats. Gurney ran on a record that included votes against civil rights legislation, foreign aid, and that ``expensive boondoggle,'' the war on poverty. Future-President George W. Bush worked as a traveling aide for <bop>Gurney<eop> while <bop>he<eop> was running for Senate in Florida.
True	In 2010 Diehl won the bronze medal at the European Individual Championships in Manchester England and in June 2010 claimed the European Tour circuit finals gold medal, beating Susan Egelstaff in the final in three sets. 2010 also saw <bop>Diehl<eop> beat current world champion Lu Lan of China to reach the semi final of Swiss Open Super Series. In <bop>her<eop> home country Russia she has won 14 national titles as of 2009.
True	The historical Octavia Minor's first husband was Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor, and she bore him three children, Marcellus, Claudia Marcella Major and Claudia Marcella Minor; the <bop>Octavia<eop> in Rome is married to a nobleman named Glabius, with whom <bop>she<eop> has no children.
True	Flag of Convenience were a rock group formed in 1982 by former Buzzcocks members Steve Diggle and John Maher, along with bassist Dave Farrow and keyboard player D.P. Through their first two line-ups they were managed by the writer and music critic <bop>Michael Gray<eop>, shortly after <bop>his<eop> personal management of Gerry Rafferty.
False	After it is revealed to Misty that Tabitha is still alive, she learns that Tabitha smokes, flirts with boys, and is not as loving, sweet, or innocent a child as she'd previously thought. Grace is the mother of Peter and ``Granmy'' to <bop>Tabitha<eop>. Misty is often annoyed by <bop>her<eop>, whether it's the way she wastes Misty's money, or the way she's influencing Tabitha.
False	She meets Muthuvel (Prabhu), an innocent youth, and they fall in love with each other. Rathnavel (R. P. Viswam) brings up his son Muthuvel without any affections and treats him like his worker, only his mother Vadivu (Vadivukkarasi) loves him. When Rathnavel arranges Muthuvel's marriage with <bop>his<eop> niece, Muthuvel and Nirmala reveal their love, Aranmanai accepts finally for their marriage with <bop>Soosai<eop>'s help.
True	In 1966 he was made Professor, History of Doctrine, at Manchester University and from 1968 until 1973 he was Professor of Theology. Following his retirement, Cunliffe-jones was Professor Emeritus. After his wife Maude died on 28 August 1989 Cunliffe-Jones lived with <bop>Margaret<eop>, his elder daughter, at <bop>her<eop> home in Essex.
False	She co-wrote ten of the thirteen songs on the album's standard edition. Harvey Mason, Jr. served as the creative director for Beautiful and co-wrote and produced a number of songs. Mauboy's exclusive interview with <bop>Melissa Doyle<eop> in Darwin was broadcast on Sunday Night on 15 September 2013. On 26 September 2013, <bop>she<eop> co-hosted The Footy Show and performed a medley of ``Inescapable'', ``To the End of the Earth'' and ``Saturday Night''.
True	Their poor receptions disillusioned Murnau, and he quit Fox to journey for a while in the South Pacific. Together with documentary film pioneer Robert Flaherty, Murnau travelled to Bora Bora to realize the film Tabu in 1931. Flaherty left after artistic disputes with <bop>Murnau<eop> who had to finish the movie on <bop>his<eop> own.
False	As a young artist in Berlin, Elisabet Ney had sculpted various luminaries of the city, including Jacob Grimm, <bop>Cosima Liszt<eop>, and Alexander von Humboldt. Ney had been patronized by the naturalist Humboldt, sculptor Christian Rauch, and diplomat Varnhagen von Ense; when all three died between late 1857 and mid 1859, <bop>she<eop> decided to travel Germany in search of new notable subjects.
True	Pinter wrote The Room over two or four days in 1957, depending on the account, at the suggestion of his friend Henry Woolf for his production as part of a postgraduate program in directing at the University of Bristol, Bristol, England. In their published interviews, Pinter and Woolf vary in describing how many days <bop>Pinter<eop> took to write The Room. According to Billington, in <bop>his<eop> official biography Harold Pinter, Woolf asked Pinter to write the play in a letter that Pinter received in the autumn of 1956, when he ``was newly married'' to actress Vivien Merchant ``and in the middle of a season at Torquay''; ``(Pinter) replied that he couldn't possibly deliver anything in under six months.
False	He is currently the wide receivers coach for Bowling Green. Doege was born in San Angelo, Texas, to Randy and Melinda Doege. He has one younger brother. Randy Doege coached at several high schools in West Texas before becoming the head coach at Crane High School in 2003. In <bop>his<eop> freshman season, 2004, Seth Doege was the starting quarterback for Crane High School and led the Golden Cranes to the area round of the playoffs, a loss to the (Tuscola) <bop>Jim Ned Indians<eop>, who were led by senior quarterback Colt McCoy.
True	The next year, though only a lieutenant-colonel, he was selected by Sir Ralph Abercromby to be quartermaster-general of his army in the Mediterranean, at the same time that another young Scotsman, John Hope, who was also to gain fame in Moore's retreat, was nominated adjutant-general. Sir Ralph placed the greatest confidence in <bop>Anstruther<eop>, and it was mainly on <bop>his<eop> report, after a visit to the Turkish headquarters, that the Turks would not be ready for a long time, if they could be of any use at all, that Sir Ralph left Marmorice Bay and determined to act alone.
False	At least one band member wrote every song on the album. Josh Osborne, Shane McAnally, and Dann Huff served as producers. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album 4 out of 5 stars, comparing its sound favorably to Alabama and <bop>Dwight Yoakam<eop>. <bop>He<eop> also stated that ``the three members construct sturdy songs with a shimmering surface to match.''
True	He helped to engineer the annexation to the city of the heavily African-American and impoverished ``Samtown'' subdivision in south Alexandria. The neighborhood was named for its white developer, Sam Jacobs. In annexing Samtown, Snyder was borrowing a page from <bop>Earl Long<eop>, who attempted to register black voters in the 1950s in anticipation of most supporting <bop>him<eop> politically in the future.
True	In a May 2010 Social Weather Stations opinion poll, AKB topped the survey, with 5.64% of the vote, the equivalent of two seats, beating seasoned party-list election contenders Buhay Hayaan Yumabong and Bayan Muna. However, AKB has been accused by the Kontra Daya (Against Cheating) group of being a creation of President <bop>Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo<eop> to expand <bop>her<eop> base of allies in the House of Representatives, a charge that AKB denied.
False	Following an unsuccessful application for the Chair of Mathematics at Aberystwyth in 1872, he taught at the Training College in Carmarthen. He finally secured the professorship at Aberystwyth in 1879, and held it until 1919. Along the way his title became Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy. Genese introduced into the United Kingdom the ideas of <bop>Hermann Grassmann<eop> (advancing the use of vector analysis). In <bop>his<eop> 1941 book The calculus of extensions, Henry Forder published numerous examples in vector analysis taken from Genese's posthumous notes.
True	In 1984, Petersen married Zina Nibley, a daughter of Hugh Nibley. They have four children and reside in Provo, Utah. Petersen has been a lecturer in the honors program at BYU, and for the English and Humanities Departments at Utah Valley University, where he received a Faculty Excellence Award in 2006. Through <bop>his<eop> familial relationship to Hugh Nibley, <bop>Petersen<eop> authored the 2002 biography Hugh Nibley:
False	In the series finale, Charlotte and Harry adopt a baby girl, Lily, from China. In the movie, Sex and the City, she and Harry have a biological baby girl, whom they name Rose. As seen in episode 8 of season 6, the New York Times wedding announcement of <bop>her<eop> and Harry's marriage indicates that Charlotte is a writer and editor for Fashions Magazine, but as this fact is not mentioned at any other time in the series or subsequent movies, it is possible it is merely a prop error- the rest of the newspaper has paragraphs taken from Big and <bop>Natasha<eop>'s wedding announcement in Season 3.
False	However, the real power lies with Philip who is declared commander of the League's army. Olympias is put aside by her husband Philip II, following Philip's marriage to a girl named Cleopatra (who is renamed Eurydice). Their son, Alexander, is effectively disowned by Philip's actions. Philip II has <bop>Ptolemy<eop>, along with other companions of <bop>his<eop> son, exiled.
True	The new Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, described Kane's allegations as ``unfounded'' to Parliament, and as a consequence Waddell inferred to a journalist that his report had not concluded that Kane's allegations were unfounded. Waddell married his wife, <bop>Dorothy<eop>, in 1940, <bop>she<eop> died in 2001.
True	It gained its first representation immediately after the 1997 election, when Puri Ruing, who had been elected for the People's Resources Awareness Party, joined the party. The party initially supported the government of Bill Skate, but later supported the government of <bop>Mekere Morauta<eop>, with Ruing made a minister in <bop>his<eop> government.
False	Detective Roe appears, and reveals he is the patriarch of the cannibal family, and the father of Leatherface (who he refers to as ``Gary''). Vanessa never escaped, the hospital room is just one of the family's sheds. Roe pulls a sheet over Vanessa's head, and he and <bop>Daisy<eop> beat <bop>her<eop> to death with a wrench.
False	The musical style is essentially tonal, evoking the work's period setting through galops and marches; instrumental interludes are highly programmatic, and choral ensembles make use of original onomatopoeic devices. The music of Treasure Island is more adventurous; colorful hornpipes are used, but the language is richly chromatic and there is considerable rhythmic intensity. Through <bop>his<eop> editorial work, Elkus has focused on the music of <bop>Charles Ives<eop>.
False	Later in the day, he announced the reappointment of Paul Biyoghe Mba as Prime Minister; he made the announcement personally ``to underline the importance of this moment''. According to Bongo, <bop>Biyoghe Mba<eop> had the necessary experience and managerial competence ``to lead us through the next stage'', and <bop>he<eop> said work would start ``immediately''.
False	Finally Tony marries Anne which irks Daniel. Soon life starts disturbing Anne as she finds out that Tony was actually cheating her as he is a conman. Tony explain her why he became a conman and his past struggling life. In between Daniel gets killed by <bop>Tony<eop> as <bop>he<eop> tries to rape Anne.
False	J*rusalem (1847, Paris) composed by Giuseppe Verdi; libretto by Alphonse Royer and Gustave Va*z Aroldo (1857, Rimini) composed by Giuseppe Verdi; libretto by Francesco Maria Piave Il talismano (1874, London) composed by Michael Balfe as The Knight of the Leopard and completed after <bop>his<eop> death by Michael Costa; libretto by <bop>Giuseppe Zaffira<eop> after Sir Walter Scott's novel, The Talisman Za*re (1887, Lille) composed by Charles Edouard Lefebvre; libretto by Paul Collin, after Voltaire's Za*re Za*re (1890, Paris), composed by Paul V*ronge de la Nux; libretto by *douard Blau and Louis Besson, after Voltaire's Za*re
False	When onlookers expressed doubt, claiming that the Proctor family was well regarded in the community, the girl promptly came out of her trance and told them it was all for ``sport''. On March 29, 1692, Abigail Williams and Mercy Lewis again said they were being tormented by Elizabeth's spectre. A few days later, Abigail complained that <bop>Elizabeth<eop> was pinching <bop>her<eop> and tearing at her bowels, and said she saw Elizabeth's spectre as well as John's.
True	The explanation offered by Muirhead is more prosaic than the fanciful rumours suggested. He examined the clothing left behind in the lighthouse and concluded that James Ducat and Thomas Marshall had gone down to the western landing stage, and that <bop>Donald MacArthur<eop> (the 'Occasional') had left the lighthouse during heavy rain in <bop>his<eop> shirt sleeves.
True	After a few years of almost no work -- although he was a guest star on Lou Grant and Charlie's Angels in the late 1970s, he once summed up the 1970s as ``I cried and did a lot of gardening'' -- he was hired in 1979 for his best-known role, self-made millionaire Palmer Cortlandt on ABC's long-running soap opera All My Children. Initially hired for only one year, he remained on contract through 2009. For much of his first decade on the show, Palmer was a ruthless villain, totally possessive of his daughter, Nina and violently threatening his ex-wife <bop>Daisy<eop> with being attacked by dobermans when <bop>she<eop> came back from the dead.
False	O'Neill was elected as part of a four-member team called ``Feminist Leadership NOW'' that took office July 21, 2009. Bonnie Grabenhofer of Illinois is executive vice president, <bop>Erin Matson<eop> from Minnesota became action vice president, and Allendra Letsome of Maryland became membership vice president. O'Neill resigned from <bop>her<eop> position as chief of staff to Councilwoman Duchy Trachtenberg of Montgomery County, Maryland in June 2009, to work full-time for NOW.
False	Alice's eldest daughter, Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven was heir presumptive to Queen Elizabeth I. She married secondly in 1600 Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley. Alice was born in Althorpe, Northamptonshire, England on 4 May 1559, the youngest daughter of Sir John Spencer, Member of Parliament and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, and <bop>Katherine Kytson<eop>. <bop>She<eop> had three brothers and three older sisters.
False	Davidson was hired on January 24, 2007 as the offensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers. Having worked as a member of the New England Patriots ' staff under Charlie Weis, Davidson forged a close relationship with him. Weis is a good friend of Panthers head coach John Fox, and it is believed that his recommendation was instrumental in Fox's decision to hire Davidson. With <bop>his<eop> playing and coaching experience at the offensive line and additional coaching with tight ends, most believe this hire meant that Coach <bop>Fox<eop> wanted to keep his focus on a powerful offense based around a strong running game, as has been his tendency in the past.
False	It is picked up by a bystander, emptied of its cash, and shoved into a wastebasket. Without the wallet, there is no way to immediately identify the body as Bullard. George Caswell, a member of the Tredway board of directors and one of the investment bankers with whom <bop>Bullard<eop> had just met, sees what <bop>he<eop> believes is Bullard's body in the street below their offices and decides to profit from the information.
True	Caswell begins to doubt that it was Bullard who died, but when he reads in a newspaper that the man had the initials ``A.B.'' on his clothes and cufflinks, he calls the police to tip them off to the identity of the deceased. Bullard had never named his successor. Over the next 28 hours, Tredway's executives vie for the position of president. Once news of <bop>his<eop> death reaches Tredway, company controller Loren Shaw takes the initiative in arranging <bop>Bullard<eop>'s funeral and coordinating the company's public reaction.
False	Around 1125 W*adys*aw married Agnes of Babenberg, daughter of Margrave Leopold III of Austria; this union gave him a close connection with the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Germany: Agnes by her mother was a granddaughter of Emperor Henry IV and a half-sister of the Franconian duke <bop>Conrad III<eop> of Hohenstaufen, the later King of Germany. Thanks to W*adys*aw, Silesia was saved during the wars of 1133--1135 with Bohemia: <bop>he<eop> stopped the destruction of the major areas of his district after the Bohemian forces crossed the Oder river.
False	In the second act, Victor's apartment is shown from a different angle, and the Krap home is still visible. For much of the act, that part of the stage is empty, except for a moment where Jacques lights the lamp and paws his master's armchair. At one point, Victor arrives, and <bop>Jacques<eop> allows <bop>him<eop> to sit in his father's chair.
False	Vybz Kartel started his career as a teenager in 1993 with his first recording ``Love Fat Woman'', released on Alvin Reid's label ``One Heart'', using the moniker ``Adi Banton'', as homage to Buju Banton. Palmer was later part of the three-member group ``Vybz Cartel'', keeping the name after the group split up, and became a protege of <bop>Bounty Killer<eop>, for whom <bop>he<eop> claims to have written nearly 30 songs, including ``Gal Clown''.
False	Re-elected in the 2007 election, she was re-named the Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and for the Estrie Region as well as the Vice-Chair of the Treasury Board. Following her 2008 re-election, Gagnon-Tremblay gave up for portfolio of International Relations to Pierre Arcand but was given the position of President of the Treasury Board previously occupied by <bop>Monique Jerome-Forget<eop> who was also responsible for the portfolio of finances. <bop>She<eop> was given Jerome-Forget's government administration portfolio duties until 2010.
False	Ralph Inzunza was a San Diego City Council District Eight representative elected in February 2001 who resigned in 2005 along with Councilman <bop>Michael Zucchet<eop> after being involved in a corruption scandal. They were convicted of extortion, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking campaign contributions from a strip club owner and <bop>his<eop> associates, allegedly in exchange for trying to repeal the city's ``no touch'' laws at strip clubs.
True	Donald P. Kanak is non-executive Chairman of Prudential Corporation Asia, the Asian division of Prudential plc. Until 2006 he was a senior executive at American International Group, and was at one time considered to succeed Hank Greenberg as CEO. After beginning <bop>his<eop> career in management consulting, <bop>Kanak<eop> entered the insurance and financial services industry in 1986.
False	His work as an arranger, producer and songwriter throughout the subsequent decades has brought him into contact with the leading Latin artists of the day, including Roc*o D*rcal and Isabel Pantoja. In addition to recording numerous hits on <bop>his<eop> own, Gabriel has produced albums for D*rcal, Lucha Villa, Lola Beltran and <bop>Paul Anka<eop>.
False	Eliza Simmons Bryant (1827 -- May 13, 1907) was an American humanitarian. She was the daughter of a freed slave and helped former slaves as a benefactor after the American Civil War. Eliza Bryant was born in North Carolina to <bop>Polly Simmons<eop>, a slave, and <bop>her<eop> master.
False	Reviewer Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone that ``Streep--at her brilliant, beguiling best--is the spice that does the trick for the yummy Julie & Julia.'' Similarly, Stephanie Zacharek of Salon concluded that ``Streep isn't playing <bop>Julia Child<eop> here, but something both more elusive and more truthful--<bop>she<eop>'s playing our idea of Julia Child.''
False	Asha Randall Asha Randall (born 6 April 1990) is an English synchronised swimmer who represented Great Britain in the team event at the 2012 London Olympics. Asha is the younger sister of synchronized swimmer <bop>Jenna Randall<eop>. Since announcing <bop>her<eop> retirement in 2013 from the sport along with her sister and other member of the London 2012 team, Asha has been performing as part Aquabatix, a synchronized swimming act which featured on Britain's Got Talent.
True	The next day HMS Fawn, under the command of Captain Thomas Fellowes, encountered Rachel and captured her, together with the 12-man prize crew of Americans. The British took the Americans on board Fawn and put a six-man prize crew on board <bop>Rachel<eop>, which they sent <bop>her<eop> into Jamaica, where the Vice admiralty court condemned her as a prize.
False	At the emergency room, the baby was pronounced dead. Suspicion mounted against Tinning, who was always alone when the children died, but there wasn't any evidence of wrongdoing. However, after a police interrogation, Tinning confessed to smothering <bop>Tami Lynne<eop>, Nathan, and Timothy (which <bop>she<eop> later retracted).
True	Towards the end of Edward's reign, Alice was accused of making his life a misery and of luring him with her charms only to further her own personal ambitions. According to Charles Cawley, Perrers had three illegitimate children by <bop>King Edward<eop>, all while their relationship was a secret from <bop>his<eop> wife, Queen Philippa and the public.
False	Alice Perrers is the protagonist of <bop>Emma Campion<eop>'s novel, The King's Mistress. <bop>She<eop> appears in Anya Seton's novel, Katherine.
False	Danny Goldman is an American actor, voice artist, and, more recently, casting director. Among <bop>his<eop> many notable credits include a small role in Young Frankenstein, the voice of Brainy Smurf and Ozzie the Answer in the 1980s detective drama <bop>Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer<eop>.
False	Aki and Mitsuko's homeroom teacher begins class, but suddenly brandishes a machine gun and opens fire, killing all the girls except Mitsuko. Before she can fire another round, Sur and Taeko burst in, grab <bop>Mitsuko<eop>, and the three hide. Another homeroom teacher, who has just killed <bop>her<eop> own entire class, finds and kills Taeko and Sur.
True	He informs Blackadder and Baldrick, ``For us, a toilet is a mundane, functional item. For you it is the basis of an entire culture!'' Before retiring to his chateau, Richthofen comments that, ``Gallant Lord Flashheart still eludes me.'' Soon after, Flashheart and Lieutenant George arrive to rescue their fellow flyers. At last facing <bop>his<eop> greatest adversary, <bop>Richthofen<eop> launches into a tedious soliloquy about chivalry and honor.
False	The babies have an awards show, and the awards go to all of the others (Stu, Fluffy, and almost Angelica). The babies fear Dil is stronger than they are. Chas thinks of a name for the puppy. Phil and Lil think a visiting friend is a disaster. Tommy, Angelica, and <bop>Susie<eop> compete in a pet show. Tommy misunderstands Taffy when he hears <bop>her<eop> say she doesn't want pickles on her burger, thinking that she is referring to Dil when she says ``I don't like dill pickles''.
True	Her world is perfectly ordered until young working-class girl, Sharon Wilkes (Beverley) is hired as the new office secretary. Initially prone to be snobbish, Elsie soon learns to appreciate Sharon and the two become friends. Many episodes revolve around the family life of either Sharon or Elsie, with <bop>Sharon<eop>'s brother Elvis (Lee Daley) and <bop>her<eop> boyfriend Wayne (John Wild) and Elsie's husband Roland (Bruce Montague) making regular appearances.
False	Although he has an ugly appearance, he is very fit, agile and nimble. He goes to Jizhou (**) and steals for a living. He is nicknamed ``Flea on a Drum'' for his excellent thieving skills.

True	Heightened political pressure and illness pushed Gordillo out from public life for about a year, though she did hold on to her post as the PRI secretary general. In early 2005 Gordillo returned to public life and Roberto Madrazo greeted her with open arms. According to PRI rules, Gordillo, as secretary general of the party, should have replaced Madrazo when <bop>he<eop> stepped down; but, in a surprise move, Mariano Palacios Alcocer took <bop>Madrazo<eop>'s position instead of Gordillo, who publicly broke with Madrazo just few days before Palacios Alcocer's election.
False	Oliveira would take a major step forward with a dramatic come-from-behind win against undefeated prospect (8--0 with 8 knockouts) Phil Williams. In that fight Oliveira was knocked down twice but rallied to knock Williams out in the seventh round. In January 2009 Oliveira defeated veteran Rayco Saunders by majority decision. In <bop>his<eop> most recent bout Oliveira defeated <bop>Otis Griffin<eop> by second-round knockout on June 5 at Grand Casino Hinckley in Minnesota.
True	The series was recorded in front of a live audience and each 30 minute episode was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 at 1pm, making some of the rude, and occasionally crude, jokes rather risqu* for the time of day. Hudd, Emmett, and Whitfield had all worked together on the very long-running radio series The News Huddlines. Holland is a familiar voice in British comedy series, probably best known for <bop>his<eop> role as <bop>Spike Dixon<eop>, the camp comic at Maplin's holiday camp, Crimpton-on-Sea, in the BBC sitcom Hi-de-Hi!

False	At the same time, Lady Elle secretly meets with the Council of Waya to tell them about her conviction that Lyka's the ``last protector'' they have been waiting for to save their clan when the next lunar eclipse occurs. As it is, some of the members are already tired of running away from their normal lives because of the curse. Unbeknownst to them, Lyka is slowly transforming into a wolf by then! After picking up her moonstone from Lady's <bop>Elle<eop>'s office, <bop>she<eop> suddenly feels a searing pain in her head and body.
False	That was the time when the raja (A prince, chief, or ruler in India) of Sheeroo Dynasty was disobeying the authority of King of Delhi, King Feroz Shah Tughlaq. When King Feroz Shah ascended the throne in 752 AH 1351 AD, Sheikh Pahar was well known as a man of sword with Arab blood, a warrior and a strategist. When the King came to know the extraordinary qualities of <bop>Sheikh Pahar<eop>, <bop>he<eop> awarded the Hari Sing & Hans Singh District to Sheikh Saheb through an edict or decree in 762 AH/1362 AD.
True	Other people whose names were cited as possible candidates were MPPs Patrick Reid, Jim Bullbrook, Jim Breithaupt and MPs Norman Cafik, John Roberts and Anthony Abbott.

True	Indeed, Jamestown produced ads for four winning gubernatorial campaigns in four years--Christie in 2013, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker in 2014, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin in 2015 and New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu in 2016. Jamestown also produced ads for the losing gubernatorial primary effort of businessman Bruce Lisman in Vermont. <bop>Baker<eop>, a moderate running in liberal Massachusetts, hired Jamestown in the final months of 2014. <bop>His<eop> closing 90-second spot, ''Remarkable State,`` was dubbed ''the selfie ad`` and was described as ''...one of the best campaign ads I saw ... featuring clip after clip of the candidate posing for selfies with voters across the state`` by political author Kristin Soltis Anderson.

Smith served as <bop>Robert Kennedy<eop> 's (RFK) campaign manager during <bop>his<eop> abbreviated 1968 presidential run.
False	Indrajith's role is that of a police officer who was tagged as a ``loser'' and hence different from other traditional cop roles. Asha Sarath was signed to play a journalist named Haritha, with the actress stating that Haritha was ``as unscrupulous as <bop>Geetha<eop>'', <bop>her<eop> character in Drishyam.
False	He has also acknowledged that the Legislative Service Commission confirmed that the bill would allow JobsOhio to spend DOD funding without Controlling Board approval or seeking further approval from the legislature.

True	He hosted the William B. Williams Show in the morning hours, and Music in a Sentimental Mood in the afternoon from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. In 1954, the originator of the Make Believe Ballroom program in New York, Martin Block, left WNEW for a new job at ABC Radio. Jerry Marshall took over the show for three years, after which <bop>Williams<eop> was tapped to host the program. <bop>He<eop> marked the broadcast as his own, using the distinctive sign-on, ``Hello, world'', and occasionally identifying himself as ``Guilliermo B. Guilliermos'' or ``Wolfgang B. Wolfgang,'' although to listeners and friends he was known simply as ``Willie B.''

False	Miller is also currently serving as the producing artistic director at Surflight Theatre in Beach Haven, New Jersey, on Long Beach Island. Miller may be new to the leadership of Surflight Theatre, but he is no stranger to the landmark theatre's 450-seat venue. While performing in a high school production of Funny Girl in <bop>his<eop> hometown of Irvington, NJ, Miller was offered an apprenticeship at Surflight by the show's director and Surflight founder <bop>Joseph P.

False	The film was on the ``Best Films'' list of over 20 national critics and was nominated for a Spirit Award for Best Screenplay by Savoca and Guay. Savoca cast many favorite New York City actors for the film which was shot in DeLaurentis/Carolco (now EUE Screen Gems) Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. The film reunited Lili Taylor with <bop>Savoca<eop>, with whom <bop>she<eop>'d previously worked on Dogfight, and Vincent D'Onofrio, with whom she'd appeared in 1988's Mystic Pizza.
True	The film follows the courtship and marriage of Catherine Falconetti (Ullman) to local butcher Joseph Santangelo (D'Onofrio), as well as Catherine's relationship with her overbearing Old World mother-in-law (Judith Malina). The film also focuses on Catherine and Joseph's daughter <bop>Teresa<eop> (Taylor), a devout Catholic more similar to <bop>her<eop> superstitious grandmother than with her modernized and secularized parents.
False	Isabel Walker is a twenty-something American film-school dropout who decides to visit her step-sister Roxanne, a poet who now lives in France. Isabel believes that she is there to help Roxanne during her pregnancy with her toddler infant, but later realizes that her father and step-mother sent her there so that Roxanne would help the shiftless Isabel gain some direction in life. Shortly after <bop>she<eop> arrives, Roxanne confides in <bop>Isabel<eop> that her French husband, Claude-Henri has left her.
False	Learning the news they return home only to find from Roxanne that Claude-Henri has decided to agree with Roxanne's wishes that the painting be left out of the divorce and instead be willed to their children.

False	Rocky travels to Dubai, where his friend Babloo (Vijay Raaz) has already tracked down Tanya, who has become Natasha, a successful singer and performer. Rocky and Babloo stakeout Natasha's villa to make sure they are on the right track, but as soon as Rocky spots Natasha, it's love at first sight. While <bop>he<eop> has Natasha under surveillance, <bop>Karan<eop> and Murugan arrive at the Dubai airport from India.
False	Rocky intervenes, and after seemingly beating the living daylights out of the supposed thugs (the scene is similar to Jean-Claude Van Damme's introductory action sequence from Hard Target (1993)), introduces himself to Natasha, and proceeds to show himself off as a charming professional with a heart of gold. Somewhat awed, Natasha offers Rocky an invitation for tea later in the evening, which he accepts. When Rocky arrives at <bop>her<eop> villa later in the evening, he is confronted by several obstacles, Natasha's sister Sweety (<bop>Supriya Pilgaonkar<eop>), the jealous Tommy and the family's pet dog.
True	He quoted extensively from Scottish jurist Baron Hume, and American psychiatrist Isaac Ray. Witnesses were produced from Glasgow to give evidence about M'Naghten's odd behaviour and complaints of persecution.

True	As described by Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone, ``The video opens on an art gallery filled with photos of Bieber's silhouette before shifting to the singer offering an emotional delivery of the track in a dark room.

False	The administration of Jewish communal affairs in Jerusalem had fallen into the hands of iniquitous officials. The poor were harshly taxed for the Muslim government; the rich were similarly treated and driven from the city by exorbitant demands upon them, so that the Jewish community was on the brink of ruin.

True	As tempting as it can be to think of Liszt as the father of modern music on the basis of his late music, looking at his achievements in these works as ends in themselves would be erroneous. Liszt's technical achievements in his late music are one side of a more complex picture. Along with the increasing interest in Hungarian and other national schools of composition already mentioned, essential parts of this picture are tragedy in Liszt's personal life and developments in his friendship with Wagner. In <bop>his<eop> later years <bop>Liszt<eop>'s problems with health, both physical and mental, affected his ability to complete compositions.
False	On 17 June 2005, after 12 years at Birmingham, Bennett transferred to Leeds United who already had Scottish international goalkeeper Neil Sullivan as first-choice goalkeeper.

True	She appears in a bathtub towards the end of Red Robin #11 as one of Ra's Al Ghul 's targets, identified as Bruce's first love, until she was rescued by Man-Bat, which shocks and scares her. A version of Julie Madison appeared in the 1997 film Batman & Robin, played by <bop>Elle Macpherson<eop>. Many of <bop>her<eop> scenes were edited out of the film's final cut, thus she is the only film love interest of Batman's to not have a prominent role.

True	Haggard had enjoyed an immensely successful artistic and commercial run with Capitol and producer Ken Nelson, accumulating twenty-four #1 country singles since 1966. According to music journalist Daniel Cooper's essay for the 1994 Haggard retrospective Down Every Road, there was no animosity or disillusionment with the Capitol brass, and the change was made simply because MCA had made a better offer.

False	The press release was coincidental with the chair of the All-party parliamentary group on Russia being due for renewal. Shortly afterwards, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who had served as a minister under Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and <bop>John Major<eop>, and was then chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, resigned from the group, saying <bop>he<eop> had been unhappy for some time about the group's behaviour and ``political direction''.

He became an avid fan of the show and was encouraged to begin drawing some of the wrestlers he saw such as Baron Von Krupp. After On the Mat was cancelled in 1984, Conlan started reading Pro Wrestling Illustrated and began following professional wrestling in the United States. Though <bop>he<eop> enjoyed WWF Superstars of Wrestling when it debuted in New Zealand in 1987, the country's first regular American wrestling show, Conlan favoured the National Wrestling Alliance, specifically Jim Crockett Promotions, partly due to being a fan of the NWA-friendly ``<bop>Apter<eop> mags'' and found its wrestlers more interesting to draw.

Drum and his friend Blaise (Kotto) are eventually sold to plantation owner Hammond Maxwell (<bop>Oates<eop>) and are both taken to <bop>his<eop> plantation to work.

A small artillery unit was also with <bop>him<eop> under Hakim Khan Sur.
True	Rod Gilmore, the game's analyst, described Jackson's prospects for the 2014 NFL Draft as follows: ``Gabe Jackson will be playing on Sundays, guaranteed. The only question is how high he goes in the NFL Draft.'' Chris Low commented, ``The top guard in the SEC going into the season, the 6-foot-4, 335-pound <bop>Jackson<eop> is a true road-grader. <bop>He<eop> combines size, power and strength and has been a fixture at left guard for the Bulldogs since his redshirt freshman season.''

False	The first caution came out on lap 9 when Aric Almirola got tapped from behind by David Ragan and spun near the entrance to pit road, nearly collecting Travis Kvapil. The race restarted on lap 11, with Busch still leading; Busch would remain there until lap 53, when Dale Earnhardt, Jr. passed him for the lead. With the help of his Busch (<bop>his<eop> former teammate), Tony Stewart passed <bop>Earnhardt<eop>, Jr. for the led while entering turn 4.
True	Homer follows one of the raccoons into the family's home under a tree stump and prepares to take them out, despite Bart warning him that he always loses fights with animals, as his battle with the earthworms proved--but Homer claims that that was phased withdrawal, but after seeing that their family is basically the raccoon version of his family, Homer cannot bring himself to do it. During a windy break, Lisa can't inhale any smoke. She realizes her only alternative is to actually smoke a cigarette, and picks one up. Right as she is about to smoke it, <bop>her<eop> father arrives and takes it away, by throwing it on the ground, squishing it with his foot, and then shooting it with a gun several times, and he is shown to be putting the gun away into his jacket. (which is also filled with other guns and weapons) Appalled, he goes to tell Marge that <bop>Lisa<eop> needs to be taken out of the ballet academy, but discovers how proud she is of Lisa; Homer is unable bear to destroy Marge's happiness.
False	Right as she is about to smoke it, her father arrives and takes it away, by throwing it on the ground, squishing it with his foot, and then shooting it with a gun several times, and he is shown to be putting the gun away into his jacket.

False	It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 30, 2008, and was written by Billy Kimball (the only sole writing credit he has received for the show to date), and directed by Lance Kramer.

False	The four-second fall from the Golden Gate Bridge sends a person plunging 245 feet (75 m) at 75 miles per hour (121 km/h) to hit the waters of the San Francisco Bay ``with the force of a speeding truck meeting a concrete building.'' Jumping off the bridge holds a 98 percent fatality rate; some die instantly from internal injuries, while others drown or die of hypothermia. In <bop>his<eop> article for The New Yorker, Tad Friend wrote, ``Survivors often regret their decision in midair, if not before,'' supported by survivor <bop>Ken Baldwin<eop> explaining, ``I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable--except for having just jumped.''
True	At age 17, Rinker moved to Seattle and worked as a sheet music demonstrator at Woolworth's. She married and divorced Ted Bailey, keeping his last name because she thought it sounded more ``American'' than Rinker, which was of Swiss (German) origin. With the help of <bop>her<eop> second husband Benny Stafford, <bop>Bailey<eop> became an established blues and jazz singer on the west coast of the United States.
False	When Gao received this news, he became even more respectful of Liang. In the aftermaths of Emperor Zhuangzong's death, Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan claimed imperial title (as Emperor Mingzong). Meanwhile, Gao Jixing prepared his fleet and wanted to attack Chu. <bop>His<eop> official <bop>Sun Guangxian<eop>, whom Liang Zhen had recommended to him to be his scribe, pointed out that Jingnan had barely recovered from the wars, and if it were engaged in a war with Chu, other states might take advantage and attack Jingnan.

False	His best result was winning U.S.A. F11 at Harbour Island, Florida without dropping a set, where he beat unseeded Barbadian Haydn Lewis in the final, 6-2, 7-6. This result, securing him 17 ATP points, saw his ranking soar by exactly 100 places. In doubles, Bester and compatriot <bop>Vasek Pospisil<eop> reached the quarter-finals of U.S.A. F5. The following week <bop>he<eop> and another Canadian, Kamil Pajkowski, also reached the quarters, this time of Canada F1.
False	The first building in Richwood was a one-room log cabin on the north side of Ottawa Street occupied by Dr. John P. Brookins and his family. Dr. Brookins was a friend of <bop>Philip<eop>'s from Mt. Vernon and had been looking for a place to practice <bop>his<eop> medicine.

True	Llewellyn failed to take a wicket in this first Test and was promptly omitted from the remainder of the series but responded by performing impressively in the 1897--98 and 1898--99 Currie Cups, which led to his recall to the national team for the first Test of the 1898--99 series against England. Llewellyn impressed by taking five wickets but was surprisingly left out of the second Test. At the end of the 1898--99 series Llewellyn, perturbed by the actions of the selectors and seeking financial security, left South Africa to play for English county side Hampshire County Cricket Club as a professional, on the recommendation of South African team-mate Major <bop>Robert Poore<eop>, an ex-Hampshire cricketer on military assignment. <bop>He<eop> would star for Hampshire for over a decade, scoring 8772 runs at 27.58 and snaring 711 wickets at 24.66.

True	Much contemporary poetry fits into one of the many aesthetic categories that lie between the polar opposites of the radically ``experimental'' poem and the ``traditional,'' often formal, poem. Dorothy Barresi's work, however, is singular in its resistance, better yet, rejection, of current poetic camps. Part Sylvia Plath, part John Donne, <bop>Barresi<eop> handles both surprise and expectation with deftness, displaying uncommon verbal ingenuity and intelligence of investigation. <bop>Her<eop> third book, Rouge Pulp, spins poems of startling metaphysical image shot through with slang and pop culture.
False	On May 23, 2009, O'Neal defeated the debuting Jayme Jameson after Krissy Vaine switched with her to become the first NWA Charlotte Women's Champion. She would turn out to be the the title's only holder due to NWA Charlotte folding in late 2009. O'Neal debuted for Women Superstars Uncensored (WSU) on August 22, 2009 in a victorious effort against <bop>Annie Social<eop>. Later in the night <bop>she<eop> got another victory over ``The Definition of Technician'' Cindy Rogers.
True	Because Dante scholars have failed to recognize this systematic allegorical function of Dante's epic, Seung maintains, they have reduced it to a grand Human Comedy, in which the mass of humanity Dante encounters in his journey can hardly leave any room for the presence of God. By <bop>his<eop> trinitarian reading, <bop>Seung<eop> securely installs the Holy Trinity as the epic hero of Dante poem.
True	In an interview conducted with FightLockdown prior to his UFC debut, Villefort stated, ``The greatest moment my career would have to be when I was in the IFL, when I fought Mike Massenzio. At the time I had only recently opened up my first gym and wasn't training enough for that fight. Everyone was saying Massenzio was ``gonna kill me'', but I believed in God, in my Judo, and in my Jiu-Jitsu skills, accepted the fight and I did what I did. Massenzio is very strong guy!'' When asked about his post-fight celebration which entails firing an invisible arrow at his opponents, Villefort stated that ``it is just a way to do tribute for my <bop>Dad<eop>, <bop>he<eop> deserves more than that, but when I shoot the arrow I make him happy!

John Wayne began working in films in 1926 as an extra, prop man, and stuntman, mainly for the Fox Film Corporation. <bop>He<eop> frequently worked in minor roles with director <bop>John Ford<eop> and when Raoul Walsh suggested him for the lead in The Big Trail (1930), an epic Western shot in an early widescreen process called Fox Grandeur, Ford vouched for him.
False	He later starred in other films such as Sawan Ko Aane Do (1979), Saanch Ko Aanch Nahin (1979), Ayaash (1982) and Itni Si Baat (1981). Ramanand Sagar cast <bop>Govil<eop> as Vikramaditya in <bop>his<eop> television series Vikram Aur Betaal and Ram in his highly successful television series Ramayan, for which he won the Uptron Award for ``Best Actor in a Leading Role'' in 1988.
False	Granell was one of those exiles from a very early age. France, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Guatemala and New York were his places of residence. In 1955, Granell travelled with Zanetti Candle to New York and built a strong friendship with <bop>Marcel Duchamp<eop>. Between 1957 and 1985 <bop>he<eop> lived mainly on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York, and was Professor Emeritus of Spanish Literature at City University of New York (CUNY).
False	He wintered in 1836-1837 at New Orleans, where he speculated again in cotton. He learned that his childless older brother John was dying of cancer.

True	Despite Bracewell and his team mates making it to the FA Cup final a year later, they had a very disappointing league season and finished 17th in the Second Division. Meanwhile, Sunderland's local rivals Newcastle United were being rejuvenated by their new manager Kevin Keegan, who offered <bop>Bracewell<eop> the chance of being part of their Division One promotion push (1992--93 saw the Second Division renamed Division One due the creation of the FA Premier League from the old First Division) and <bop>he<eop> accepted this offer.

Olivia urges <bop>Stanner<eop> to come clean about <bop>her<eop> affair and release a statement to the media.
False	Early in 1934, Addams had a heart attack and Smith nursed her at her home, neglecting her own illness. Smith succumbed to pneumonia, fell into a coma and then died on 22 February 1934. Addams was considered too ill to descend the stairs to attend <bop>Smith<eop>'s memorial service, which <bop>she<eop> could hear from her second-floor room.
True	Mary Poppins also had a very similar attitude while actively encouraging positive imagination (Susan tends to say things like ``Real children don't go hoppity-skip unless they're on drugs''), took children on magical adventures (Susan does so to teach geography), introduced children to supernatural creatures (Susan employs such beings as guest speakers, including her own grandfather), and had a magic umbrella (which, while not used as a blunt object, was magical much like Death's scythe). Neither character openly acknowledges her magical powers. Both tend toward being actively insulted when reminded of their use. The link between Susan and Mary Poppins is explicitly alluded to in Hogfather, when <bop>Susan<eop> states that ``<bop>She<eop>'d sworn that if she did indeed ever find herself dancing on rooftops with chimney sweeps, she'd beat herself to death with her own umbrella.''
True	Gooden claimed that an enraged Mitchell held him hostage during the alleged cat incident. Mitchell responded to Gooden's accusations by accusing Gooden of fabricating the stories in an attempt to divert attention away from Gooden's personal problems. In the famous tenth inning of Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, after Wally Backman and Keith Hernandez had been retired for the first two outs, <bop>Mitchell<eop> went to the clubhouse to make plane reservations for home in San Diego. However, <bop>he<eop> was called to pinch hit for reliever Rick Aguilera after Gary Carter, the next hitter after Hernandez, singled.

False	The president of SAG -- future United States President Ronald Reagan -- also known to the FBI as Confidential Informant ``T-10'', testified before the committee but never publicly named names. Instead, according to an FBI memorandum in 1947: ``T-10 advised Special Agent (name deleted) that <bop>he<eop> has been made a member of a committee headed by Mayer, the purpose of which is allegedly is to 'purge' the motion-picture industry of Communist party members, which committee was an outgrowth of the <bop>Thomas<eop> committee hearings in Washington and subsequent meetings ....
True	By traveling up the north side of the Potomac River, which was easier because of the mountainous terrain on the south side, the party missed the stream which gives the town its name. On the return trip, however, the explorers discovered the stream and subsequently placed it on the map as a ``new creek.'' Together with Professor Alexander Irvin, <bop>Mayo<eop> was also responsible for setting the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina. One of the rivers intersecting the line was named the Mayo River in <bop>his<eop> honor.
True	It was eventually announced that Anderson would take on Van Dam at Victory Road for a shot at the title. A feud that went into Victory Road was between A.J. Styles, Matt Hardy and Ric Flair.

Hank Pym watches over <bop>her<eop> in the hospital, and when she recovers, they reconcile.
False	Harriet Lepel Phipps, VA (1841 -- 7 March 1922) was a confidential attendant of Queen Victoria. Harriet was the younger daughter of Sir Charles Beaumont Phipps, a courtier and confidant of the Queen, as Keeper of the Privy Purse. Harriet was appointed Maid of Honour in Ordinary to the <bop>Queen<eop> on 3 March 1862 (giving <bop>her<eop> the courtesy rank of a baron's daughter), and later served as a Woman of the Bedchamber from 1889 until Victoria's death.
True	The CEO and chairman of the WWE, Vince McMahon, his daughter Stephanie, and son-in-law Triple H decided to control Raw as a team. However, they differed between the three decisions. On the July 8 episode of Raw, Triple H, Vince, and Stephanie would decide the fate of the Managing Supervisor <bop>Vickie Guerrero<eop>. While Vince wanted to promote <bop>her<eop> as the definitive General Manager of the show, Triple H voted for the resignation of Guerrero.
False	Roman Steinberg (April 5, 1900 -- April 16, 1928) from Tallinn, Estonia, was a Greco-Roman wrestling bronze medal winner in middleweight class at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.

False	Stevens and Bockwinkel protested the outcome of the match to the AWA Championship Committee, which held up the championship immediately after the match, but the original match decision was upheld days later after the committee ruled that there was no evidence that Zbyszko had illegally aided Hennig. As a result, the championship was returned to the now heel-turned Hennig. Stemming from the events of that match, Stevens feuded briefly with <bop>Zbyszko<eop> before finishing out <bop>his<eop> career in 1992, after 42 years.
False	He was even caught and photographed naked on set. Co-star Madeline Wool and the actress who played 'Broccoli woman' managed to resist his overly aggressive advances. The Broccoli actress even asked Marenghi to remove <bop>Todd<eop> from the series which, of course, <bop>he<eop> could not do.
True	They attempted this by beating the fire with long stage poles. The curtains rose while backstage personnel hastened to bring the fire under control, the actors beginning the scene. After speaking a few lines, Claxton was made aware of the fire by <bop>Lillian Cleaves<eop>, another actress backstage who was standing behind the box set. <bop>She<eop> whispered sotto voce through the canvas of the boathouse that there was fire on stage and urged them to leave.
False	He was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1951, and an Officer of the order (OBE) in the 1958 honours list.

True	All the evidence suggests that Niall remained in Robert's warband for the years to come, fighting both the English-side generally and the MacDougalls in the west of Scotland. Niall even acted as a representative of Robert in negotiations with the English crown, on two occasions, in 1309 and 1314. As a reward for <bop>his<eop> loyal services to King Robert, <bop>Niall<eop> received his sister, Mary Bruce, in marriage.
False	Following the death of Tewodros II's much loved first wife, Empress Tewabech Ali (who was Tiruwork's niece), his intimates began to discreetly look for an appropriate consort to provide him with an heir and to calm his more extreme moods as his late wife had done. Legend states that one of the Emperor's officers was attending Sunday services at a church at Derasge when Tewodros was staying there, and was struck at the beauty, the aristocratic deportment, and the deep piety of a woman worshiping there. <bop>He<eop> immediately went to the <bop>Emperor<eop> and told him he had seen the woman ``meant to be the wife of my sovereign''.
True	Everyone believed 10-year-old Candace hung herself so she was buried in the part of the cemetery where sinners were buried, since suicide was considered a sin.

Despite Suzanne's effort to evict the ghost out of <bop>her<eop> new husband's house, Candace still held the threat of making <bop>Suzanne<eop>'s new family shatter.
False	This, he charged, should be devoted to the souls of himself, his wife, Kings Henry IV and V, and to each past, present and future member of the Order of the Garter. In 1421 Robert acted as his nephew's executor, following Gilbert's death in the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Baug*. From <bop>his<eop> nephew, <bop>Umfraville<eop> inherited the Redesdale and Kyme estates; he had already lost his lordship of Langley in 1414 when the second Earl of Northumberland was restored to his patrimony.
True	Her 2008 re-election was closer, with Boseman taking 51.7% of the vote and winning by a margin of about 3,000.

After an awkward romantic attraction to Pressman, <bop>she<eop> arranges for Jeremiah to visit Princeton, where she and a colleague, Corinne, are rivals to succeed the soon-to-retire Dean of Admissions.
True	He succeeded to his father's lands because his older brother Michael Komnenos had been abducted and imprisoned in Constantinople. After succeeding his father in or shortly before 1289, Constantine ruled Thessaly and Central Greece from Neopatras. He was assisted by his younger brother Theodore Angelos, who died c. 1300. Early in <bop>his<eop> reign, <bop>Constantine<eop>'s mother entered into negotiations with the Byzantine Empire and, in exchange for recognizing nominal Byzantine suzerainty, Constantine was invested with the court title of sebastokrat*r.
False	In 1806, still commanding his cavalry division (23rd, 29th and 30th Dragoon Regiments), he was present at the siege and capture of the fortress of Gaeta, on the west coast of Italy. During the second French invasion of Portugal in 1809, Mermet led a division under Marshal <bop>Nicolas Soult<eop>. <bop>He<eop> fought at the First Battle of Porto on 28 March and the Battle of Grij* on 11 May.

Freed due to lack of evidence against <bop>her<eop>, Vivian realizes that Victor loves Maggie and not her, and divorces Victor.
True	Victor also took an active role in helping Bo overcome his illness by bringing his godson Dr. Daniel Jonas to Salem. Victor suffered from a stroke and was incapacitated at University Hospital under the care of Dr. Daniel Jonas. Somehow, Victor was aware that Bo had received evidence that would possibly implicate Philip in the disappearance of Paul Hollingsworth. Recovering in the hospital from <bop>his<eop> stroke, <bop>Victor<eop> commiserated with Kate and expressed his fear that the worst may be yet to come for Philip.
False	Challenge of the Masters (Chinese: *******) is a 1976 martial arts-action film released in Hong Kong by Shaw Brothers, and directed by Lau Kar Leung.

In 1998, when Liga Veneta split between Venetists and Padanists, Renato Martin, Mayor of Jesolo and friend of J*rg Haider, was one of the leaders of the second group. After <bop>he<eop> had lost the leadership race to <bop>Gian Paolo Gobbo<eop>, he too chose to leave the party.
False	Frutkin believed that the USA had never lost the Korean War as the aim of the USA had been to prevent North Korea from taking over South Korea, in which they had been successful. This opinion went against what many of his colleagues at the time, including Thomas Paine, believed. Nonetheless, in 1973, Frutkin was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal by Thomas Paine, and Frutkin commented that <bop>Paine<eop> had always been ``wonderful'' to <bop>him<eop>.
False	Deanna graduated with a degree in graphic design. She had been working in this field for approximately a year and a half when she was asked to go on tour with a band. That band was ``Mask'', based in Willoughby, Ohio which featured Deanna in various costumes dressed as Madonna, Cher, <bop>Tina Turner<eop> and others, and local drummer Steve Shutts, local male vocalist Dave Richards, and a couple of fellow Canadians. <bop>She<eop> quit that gig after friends urged her to move on, and Deanna has never looked back.

False	Samuel Johnson and Topham Beauclerk debated whether Hackman had meant to kill only himself. Johnson believed that the two pistols Hackman took with him to Covent Garden meant that he intended there to be two deaths. Boswell himself (who had visited <bop>Hackman<eop> in prison) wrote that the case showed ``the dreadful effects that the passion of Love may produce''. In <bop>his<eop> Mind-Forg'd Manacles (1987), the social historian Roy Porter argues that Hackman was well aware of the madness of his passion.
False	She made her screen debut as a dancer in Alan Parker's 1980 musical drama Fame. Tilly's dance career came to an abrupt halt when, in 1979, a dance partner dropped her, causing a serious back injury. Forced to give up dancing because of complications stemming from <bop>her<eop> back injury, Tilly moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as an actress and studied acting under <bop>Peggy Fuery<eop>.
True	The Pageant attracts thousands of members of the Royal Black Preceptory, a group related to the Orange Order, who come to march and stage a symbolic (sham) re-enactment of the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. In June 1690, a Williamite army of 30,000 men camped in the Scarva area for training before marching on to meet the forces of King James II at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690. Whilst training <bop>his<eop> army, <bop>King William<eop> is said to have camped under a magnificent Spanish chestnut tree.
True	There are also signs during Ranulf's administration of resident justices in the counties who held courts for the king. Itinerant justices were probably also used to hear pleas that were reserved to the crown. While administering England for Rufus, <bop>Ranulf<eop> also supervised construction projects. Under <bop>his<eop> management, the first stone bridge in London was constructed.

False	Alice went to live with Nick's sister Kathy, who desperatley tried to contact Elsa but was shocked to discover she'd moved to Australia without telling anyone. Relising <bop>she<eop> was all Alice had left and just how selfish and uncaring <bop>Elsa<eop> was, Kathy took custody of Alice.
False	He was replaced on tour by Chris ``Tank'' Murk throughout their summer touring of 2007. Before going into the studio to record their second album I Swear..., the band chose Chris Carroll as their new permanent drummer. Jeremy Gifford replaced <bop>Brian<eop> on bass guitar throughout the rest of 2007 playing on tour dates and recording with the band. <bop>He<eop> left the band in 2008 and started playing guitar for the band Lovedrug.
False	A few days later, McClusky allegedly saw his hat in a Broadway store under a sign which read ``Step in and buy a Merry Widow. The kind wore by Inspector McClusky, the swellest cop in the world''. Two years later, McClusky became a police inspector and assigned to the Fifth District by Commissioner <bop>Francis V. Greene<eop>. At 42 years old, <bop>he<eop> was the youngest man in the NYPD to hold the position.
False	Robinson had not even brought his boots for the match and borrowed Starling's. He scored the goal in a 1--1 draw. Five days later Robinson was a non-playing member of the Wednesday squad which beat West Bromwich 4--2 in the FA Cup final. Conscious of <bop>his<eop> young age, <bop>Billy Walker<eop> only used Robinson occasionally in the 1935--36 season, and he made just five appearances.
False	Walters also co-founded Unknown Public in 1992 and works as a writer and editor. Pask worked as a sessions player and co-wrote the theme music for the long-running British ITV series The Bill. Thoms later appeared on <bop>Thomas Dolby<eop>'s 1984 album The Flat Earth and toured with Dolby that year playing trombone. <bop>He<eop> also served as a member of staff at the Musicians' Union's head office in Britain.
False	Ellison's recollection is that ``Kent, my county, were playing a game against Leicestershire in July and I approached captain David Gower and said: 'I'm going to make you pick me. ' I soon started to take wickets and was called into the squad for the fourth Test in Manchester.'' Ellison took 3--58 in the first-class match, including <bop>Gower<eop>'s wicket in the only innings in which <bop>he<eop> bowled.
False	Writing a decade later, George C*linescu noted that Ruinelor Cet**ii Neam*u was ``a disgraceful replica of C*rlova's Ruinurile T*rgovi*tii''. He also stressed the misogyny present in several lyrics authored by Hrisoverghi, which he defined as ``(having) the stray impulses of Romantic jokes and featuring ridiculous invectives''. In respect to this, he cited the stanza: Besides <bop>his<eop> translation of Dumas' novel, Alexandru Hrisoverghi is noted for those of poems by <bop>Ch*nier<eop> (to which he notably added his own verses), Friedrich Schiller (probably, through a French-language translation), Alphonse de Lamartine, and Victor Hugo.
False	There Are Debts is an album by David Hopkins, released in December 2010. It was produced by Matt Fish (musician and producer). All songs were written by David Hopkins. Strings and horns were arranged by David Hopkins. To promote the album David Hopkins performed live on Today with <bop>Pat Kenny<eop> (Monday 4 April 2011). <bop>He<eop> also performed live on PBS' Vegas In Tune.
True	She might look like butter wouldn't melt, but she's her father's daughter through and through.'' She was also described as conniving, backstabbing and cold-hearted. Altman described Dotty as ``a chip off the old block'', as did Nancy Banks-Smith from The Guardian though the Daily Record described <bop>Dotty<eop> as ``a chip off <bop>her<eop> grandma's block''.
False	She shifted to high school, working in Gu*nica between 1942 and 1957. In 1947 and again in 1955, she served as acting school principal. Her first marriage ended in divorce and on December 25, 1944, she married Ismael Olivieri. The couple subsequently had two daughters, Antonia and <bop>Rebeca Olivieri Figueroa<eop>. In 1947, <bop>she<eop> published her first book of poetry Acridulces, which was described by critics as neo-Romantic, but which placed her within the first generation of academic and professional Puerto Ricans known as the Generation of the 50s.
False	He missed weeks 6 through 8 with a sprained ankle. In week 11 against St. Louis, Williams filled in for Foster, who had injured his elbow, and totaled 20 carries for 114 yards. In a Monday Night Football game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Williams started for an injured <bop>DeShaun Foster<eop> and managed 74 rushing yards on 17 carries and an impressive 101 receiving yards on 7 catches with a touchdown. <bop>He<eop> had 501 rushing yards and 1 touchdown on the year.
False	Robinson composed An American Requiem, which had its New England Premiere under the direction of Dr. Robert Russell and the USM Chorale. He also wrote ``Driving Old Memories'' with his father Ervin Robinson, and the country song ``Momma Never Had Life Easy -- So She Made Life Easy for Me''. In 2012 <bop>he<eop> wrote the music for the independent documentary In the Shadows of Grey Gardens In an article entitled ``Robinson and Ragtime'', <bop>David Welker<eop> called him ``one of today's leading proponents of early jazz and ragtime music''.
False	Warner with the suggestion she and her sisters star in the film. Warner agreed, and Leota was summoned from New York to test for the part of <bop>Emma<eop>, but proved unsuitable. The studio substituted Gale Page, a young contractee as the fourth daughter. The actress would be tagged for the rest of <bop>her<eop> career as the fourth Lane.
True	Since EDS had its own stock, there was an inherent conflict of interest between the companies- an EDS employee working in Detroit at a GM plant was not primarily concerned about GM's performance, but about EDS performance, so they had a blank check to throw money at problems, bill GM, and watch their EDS stock go up. Finally, as Lee quotes Perot - ``GM doesn't honor its contracts'' - Smith had said <bop>he<eop> would not interfere with Perot, but the relationship fractured from the start, with conflicts over promised compensation to EDS executives being rejected by <bop>Smith<eop>, who also sent auditors to EDS to irritate Perot.
True	This army, known as the Atholl Highlanders, conducts largely social and ceremonial activities, and primarily consists of workers on the extensive Atholl Estates. The Castle no longer belongs directly to the Duke of Atholl, as the 10th Duke, <bop>George Iain Murray<eop> (1931--96), left the Castle in trust upon <bop>his<eop> death.
False	Jean-Gabriel De Tarde or Gabriel Tarde in short (12 March 1843, Sarlat-la-Can*da, Dordogne -- 13 May 1904, Paris) French sociologist, criminologist and social psychologist who conceived sociology as based on small psychological interactions among individuals (much as if it were chemistry), the fundamental forces being imitation and innovation. Among the concepts that Tarde initiated were the group mind (taken up and developed by <bop>Gustave Le Bon<eop>, and sometimes advanced to explain so-called herd behaviour or crowd psychology), and economic psychology, where <bop>he<eop> anticipated a number of modern developments.
False	On a personal note, there was an outstanding event in his life: he went back to his home country, Japan, in 1997 after 21 years of absence. In 1998 he was given the task to organize the first National Tournament ``Iwata Cup'' in Monterrey, NL, in partnership with Murayama Master. Toshiaki Nogiwa received the <bop>7th Dan Shito-Ryu Karate-Do Sosei-Kai<eop> and 4th Dan Shinkyokuryu Taijitsu degreees. The Pan American Budo Nippon Soseikai appointed <bop>him<eop> as Technical Advisor in 2005.
True	The exhibition will display works of Mr. Kwan, many are shown on a loan basis with the kind consent of galleries and friends, as well as related articles, photos and information. It will not only provide a broad view of the creations of Mr. Kwan, a core figure of our art scene, but also an opportunity to look at the life of an enthusiastic and committed artist. Dedicated to <bop>his<eop> life to art making, <bop>Jerry<eop> used oil painting as his major medium of expression in his artwork.
True	Who was that ``Duke Knut'', Cecilia's historically mentioned father? Three sufficiently possible and credible alternatives have been proposed: * Knut Birgersson Jarl has been deemed somewhat uneasy choice because of chronological problems. That Knut died 1208, and because of her children's age and her own likely death date, Cecilia firstly need to have been born in the very end of Knut's life (c 1208) when Knut was already elderly (and several decades after birth of that Knut's other attested child/children); and even that makes <bop>Cecilia<eop> somewhat old for <bop>her<eop> own marriage and to give birth to her attested children, at last one of whom was executed in 1280 and Cecilia possibly was then living.
False	Finn, along with fellow original De Dannan member Johnny ``Ringo'' McDonagh, has recently reformed De Dannan with banjoist/keyboardist Brian McGrath, accordionist Derek Hickey, fiddler Mick Conneely, and singer Eleanor Shanley. Alec Finn is the older brother of the author <bop>Gervase Phinn<eop>. <bop>He<eop> changed the spelling of his surname form Phinn to Finn upon moving to Ireland from his childhood home in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.
True	He was also officially charged by Hassan II to prepare his visit to Washington D.C. from April 22nd to 27th, but was secretly told he had to conduct negotiations about secret US military bases in Morocco who pay a rent directly into the royal coffers . There, he also investigated why Pan American World Airways had decided against building an Intercontinental Hotel in Casablanca. In California, Medbouh discovered the reason : <bop>William P<eop>. Rogers, Secretary of State had received a file, from <bop>his<eop> friend the president of the Pan American World Airways, containing photocopies of letters from Morocco.
False	On completion of the initial version, David immediately began work on the second version which was finished on 25 May, the date of Bonaparte's inspection of the portraits at David's Louvre workshop. Two of David's pupils assisted him in producing the different versions: J*r*me-Martin Langlois worked primarily on the first two portraits, and George Rouget produced the copy for Les Invalides. In contrast to <bop>his<eop> predecessors <bop>Fran*ois Boucher<eop> and Jean-Honor* Fragonard, who employed a red or grey undercoat as a base colour on which to build up the painting, David employed the white background of the canvas directly underneath his colours, as some of his unfinished works show, such as his first attempt at a portrait of Bonaparte or his sketch of the Tennis Court Oath.
True	Some of the more intriguing articles range from ``A Psychopathological Discussion of Christ'' to ``The Pig in its Poetical, Mythological and Cultural-Historical Aspects.'' Among the literary works published during his Swiss exile in 1898 were the political satire Psichopatia Criminalis and the historical drama Nero. Throughout <bop>his<eop> Swiss sojourn, <bop>Panizza<eop>'s mental health gradually began to deteriorate.
False	The King Cole Trio (featuring Jack Costanzo on bongos) recorded the song July 26, 1949. ``Boulevard of Broken Dreams'' is a signature song of Tony Bennett who was signed by Mitch Miller to Columbia Records on the strength of Bennett's 1949 demo of the song. In <bop>his<eop> debut Columbia session on 17 April 1950 at CBS 30th Street Studio Bennett - backed by the <bop>Marty Manning<eop> orchestra - recorded ``Boulevard of Broken Dreams'' to serve as Bennett's major label debut single release on 27 April 1950.
True	The instrumental of ``Let It Go'' was mixed with the a capella of ``Addicted to You'' to become ``Addicted to You (Avicii by Avicii)''. On 29 December 2012, Bergling released ``I Could Be the One'' with Nicky Romero. After first being debuted at <bop>his<eop> shows almost a year earlier, the track finally got released via <bop>Bergling<eop>'s record label LE7ELS.
True	A January 2015 issue of Newsweek magazine featured an article detailing reports of sexism and misogyny in Silicon Valley. The article's author, Nina Burleigh, asked, ``Where were all these offended people when women like <bop>Heidi Roizen<eop> published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick <bop>her<eop> hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?''
False	Theresa, her brother Sancho and sister Urraca were the only children of Afonso and Matilda to survive to adulthood. Named after <bop>her<eop> paternal grandmother, <bop>Countess Theresa<eop>, she was reputedly King Afonso I's favourite.
True	But Gaiman also acknowledged that his Faerie was a fiction, a land where metaphor was made real but also remained metaphor: when Timothy Hunter was taken to the land by Doctor Occult, the mystic admitted that in some ways the two of them were still sitting in a field exploring only their inner landscapes. Gaiman also showed an ambiguous section that was interpreted by some to suggest that Queen Titania was the mother of the comic's main character, Timothy Hunter, which ensured that the realm of Faerie was further explored when the mini-series became an ongoing series. When <bop>he<eop> was chosen to replace Gaiman as the writer of the ongoing The Books of Magic series, <bop>John Ney Rieber<eop> discovered that a gaming guide to the DC universe had listed Titania as Hunter's mother: he also knew that a key part of the character's appeal, however, was that he was a normal teenaged boy.
True	Hugh Laing and Francisco Moncion also danced it before it lapsed from the performance rota for a decade. It was restaged in 1960 with Edward Villella in the title role (Villella recounts his work in recreating the role in his autobiography of the same name). Mikhail Baryshnikov danced it with City Ballet in 1979 and <bop>Damian Woetzel<eop> danced it at <bop>his<eop> farewell performance on Wednesday, 18 June 2008.
False	Later in 2009 he appeared alongside John Nettles, James Fox, Sylvestra le touzel, Frances Barber and Richard Fleeshman in the prestigious ITV Drama Series Midsomer Murders as the young manipulative concert pianist Orlando Guest in the episode titled ``Masterclass'' directed by Renny Rye. Thomas is currently appearing on Broadway as the alternate '<bop>Peter Parker<eop>' in the Broadway theatre production of the musical . <bop>He<eop> is scheduled two shows weekly as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.
True	He inadvertently confronted a crowd of people gathered around a preacher, Nazir Ahmad Ali, who was to later become a pioneering missionary in Sierra Leone. Whilst Ali was preaching, a chief requested Salih to judge the message brought by Ali. With the exception of two things, which ``held <bop>his<eop> throat'', <bop>Salih<eop> found that the message coincided with the teachings of the Quran.
True	It is revealed that all superpowers come from Compound V, a drug invented by Nazi scientists; a low-powered version mixed with cocaine is called Blue, and it is used to attain a singular, powerful high (or, as revealed during the surveillance, allows prostitutes to endure or recover from sex with superhumans), but it carries a risk of spontaneous and horrifying mutations. Judging that <bop>he<eop> is suitable to join the team, Butcher injects <bop>Hughie<eop> with a specially formulated mix of V that gives him super-strength and durability--much to Hughie's chagrin.
False	Wade asks Daisy to marry him and the ceremony is held on the Swans' estate. On the first night of their honeymoon in Arizona, he drives off and leaves her. When she returns to Raymond's house, an extremely intoxicated Melora reveals to <bop>Daisy<eop> that <bop>she<eop> had an affair with the closet homosexual Wade.
True	In the mid-1930s, Daisy Clover is a teenage tomboy, living in a ramshackle trailer on a California beach with her eccentric mother Lucile. She dreams about becoming a Hollywood actress and submits a recorded song to a well-known film producer, Raymond Swan. Swan puts her under contract for five years. Raymond's wife, Melora, counsels <bop>Daisy<eop>, forcing <bop>her<eop> to deal with her job and life.
False	Ellen Arden (Monroe), a photographer and mother of two small children, has been declared legally dead, having been lost at sea in the Pacific. <bop>Her<eop> husband Nick (Dean Martin) has remarried; he and his new wife, <bop>Bianca<eop> (Cyd Charisse), are on their honeymoon when Ellen, rescued from an island where she has been stranded for five years, returns home.
False	The original administrators of the Foundation included Maurice Renand, a tax inspector who was the son of Georges--Eug*ne Renand, chairman of the la Semeuse de Paris, first manager of La Samaritaine, chair of the Cognac-Jay Foundation, director of the administrative services of the Presidency of the Council in 1942, and a close collaborator of <bop>Pierre Laval<eop> (1943-1944). <bop>His<eop> son Georges succeeded Rene de Chambrun as head of the foundation.
True	The new 6th District was based around the eastern suburbs of Camden inclusive of Cherry Hill, stretching from Berlin borough north to Pennsauken and included Burlington County's Evesham Township and Palmyra. Croce and Gallagher defeated Republicans William K. Dickey, a former Speaker of the Assembly, and Eugene Raymond III. Croce and Gallagher were re-elected in 1975, again defeating both Dickey and Raymond. In 1977, Croce and running mate <bop>Barbara Berman<eop>, running in <bop>her<eop> first race for elected office, defeated Republicans Mario A.
True	In 1977, Croce and running mate Barbara Berman, running in her first race for elected office, defeated Republicans Mario A. Iavicoli and Dickey (for the third time); Croce was the top vote-getter and Berman came in second, edging Iavicoli by a 170-vote margin. When Berman and <bop>Croce<eop> took office in January 1978, <bop>she<eop> and Berman became the first pair of women to be elected to a single Assembly district in state history, and were two of the 12 women taking office in the Assembly, the highest number ever to serve together in the 80-seat body.
True	These laws kept people from declaring candidacy the day before an election, requiring the professio to be made before a certain set date. Politicians running for a position of power in the Roman Republic followed campaigning strategies similar to those used by modern politicians. In a contemporary letter written to consul candidate Marcus Cicero by <bop>his<eop> brother, Quintus, during <bop>Marcus<eop>' campaign, Quintus wrote on the various campaigning strategies that would help Marcus be elected.
True	In 1995, it was a finalist in the Benedictus Awards, described by the jury as ``a remarkable anti-structure ... a symbolic use of technology ... a piece of sculpture. It was meant as an object but it is an object to transmit light.'' The Inverted Pyramid figures prominently on the concluding pages of Dan Brown's international bestseller The Da Vinci Code. The protagonist of <bop>his<eop> novel, <bop>Robert Langdon<eop>, reads esoteric symbolism into the two pyramids:
True	During her time at UMass Amherst, she has taught numerous students who would become notable linguists including Gennaro Chierchia and Irene Heim. Through her interactions with the philosopher and logician Richard Montague at UCLA in the 1970s she played an important role in bringing together the research traditions of generative linguistics, formal logic, and analytic philosophy, pursuing an agenda pioneered by <bop>David Lewis<eop> in <bop>his<eop> 1970 article General Semantics.

False	She sets conditions, however. Peeta, Johanna Mason, Annie Cresta, and Enobaria, fellow Games victors captured by the Capitol, are to be granted immunity. Katniss also demands the privilege of killing Snow, but Coin only agrees to flip for the honor. For <bop>her<eop> sake, a rescue mission is mounted that succeeds in rescuing Peeta, <bop>Johanna<eop> and Annie.
True	Neither Alec nor his brother ever married. They lived together in Woking until Eric's death in 2006. Sir Alec Bedser died in hospital in Woking on 4 April 2010 after a short illness. Among those to pay tribute to the more famous of the two brothers was former Prime Minister and well-known cricket lover John Major, who said: ``<bop>Alec Bedser<eop> was one of the greatest medium-fast bowlers of all time. <bop>He<eop> was also one of the great thinkers about cricket and his wisdom was one of the great untapped resources of the modern game.''
False	Kolenkhov brings up that the Romans' hobby was wrestling, and demonstrates on Mr. Kirby by throwing him on the floor. To pass the time after the awkward incident, Penny suggests they play a free association game. Alice imagines what is coming and immediately tries to quash the suggestions, but <bop>Penny<eop> shrugs <bop>her<eop> off and instructs everyone to write down ``the first thing that pops into their heads'' after she says certain words.
True	Essie is married to Ed Carmichael, a xylophone player who lives with them and helps distribute Essie's candies. Ed is an amateur printer who prints any phrase that sounds catchy. Paul and Penny's other daughter <bop>Alice Sycamore<eop> is quite obviously the only ``normal'' family member. <bop>She<eop> has an office job and is sometimes embarrassed by the eccentricities of her family, yet deep down, she still loves them.
True	She is an extremely prim and proper woman and is horrified by the goings-on in the Sycamore household. Her hobby is spiritualism. G-Man 1 (The Man), G-Man 2 (Jim), G-Man 3 (Mac) Three agents who come to investigate <bop>Ed<eop> because of the communist quotes <bop>he<eop> prints up and places in Essie's candy boxes, such as ``God is the State -- the State is God''.
True	After a back and forth game, the score was tied 0--0 at full-time, and remained so after extra time, leading to a penalty kick shootout. With Briana Scurry's save of China's third kick, the score was 4--4 with only <bop>Brandi Chastain<eop> left to shoot. <bop>She<eop> scored and won the game for the United States.
True	Peary's team was also far more experienced in the ancient art of dog sledging. Peary's exploits and life were portrayed in the 1998 TV movie Glory & Honor. Henry Czerny played <bop>Robert Peary<eop>. <bop>His<eop> associate Matthew Henson was played by Delroy Lindo.
False	The Council of Mantua of 1459, or Congress of Mantua, was a religious meeting convoked by Pope Pius II, who had been elected to the Papacy in the previous year and was engaged in planning war against the <bop>Ottoman Turks<eop>, who had taken Constantinople in 1453. <bop>His<eop> call went out to the rulers of Europe, in an agonized plea to turn from internecine warfare to face Christendom's common enemy.
False	Torn - Torn is the Underground's second in command in Jak II and a Freedom League General in the war in Jak 3. In Jak II, Torn frequently sends Jak on missions to uncover information on the city, or more often than not, to carry out strikes on the <bop>Baron<eop>'s forces. As an ex-Krimzon Guard of high authority <bop>he<eop> has witnessed the Baron's evil deeds.
False	One of the most well-known studies to demonstrate this was led by Sara Lazar, from Harvard University, in 2000. Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, has led experiments in cooperation with the <bop>Dalai Lama<eop> on effects of meditation on the brain. <bop>His<eop> results suggest that long-term or short-term practice of meditation results in different levels of activity in brain regions associated with such qualities as attention, anxiety, depression, fear, anger, the ability of the body to heal itself.
True	She kept her head down, tried to make amends with her friends and steered clear of men but she wasn't alone for long. When she met police officer Martin Crowe at a kid's judo class, Louise felt a frisson of attraction. They became friends and after a while, romance blossomed. However, Louise was taking on Martin's daughter, Kayleigh, too. As <bop>she<eop> didn't have children, <bop>Louise<eop> didn't know how to behave around Kayleigh -- who worshipped her from the start.
False	In addition, her father was the first head of their church's credit union, which helped the parishioners with small loans. Polly has two sisters: Fernie, now a retired Dean from the University of Colorado, and <bop>Bettie Baca<eop>, a consultant in Washington, DC. <bop>Her<eop> great-grandfather helped found Trinidad, Colorado.
False	Wendi Richter was trained at The Fabulous Moolah's Lillian Ellison School of Professional Wrestling by Lelani Kai, Judy Martin and Joyce Grable and made her professional debut in 1979. In early 1982, Richter tag teamed with Moolah against Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria for three matches for the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Richter was later paired with <bop>Joyce Grable<eop>, with whom <bop>she<eop> also trained for six weeks, to form a tag team called The Texas Cowgirls.
True	On January 29, 2005, Richter appeared at WrestleReunion in an eight-woman tag team match (teaming with Bambi, Malia Hosaka, and Jenny Taylor wrestling against Sherri Martel, Peggy Lee Leather, Krissy Vaine, and Amber O'Neal. In August of that same year, <bop>Richter<eop> appeared at the second WrestleReunion event, WrestleReunion 2, in a six-person tag team match. In the years after <bop>her<eop> retirement, Richter was uninvolved with wrestling.
False	It is the first film by independent superstar director Dan Garcia, who produced Death Toll and Sinners and Saints. Louisiana Governor Chip Majors (James DuMont) is front in line to be North Carolina Senator Edmonds' (<bop>Steven Bauer<eop>) Vice Presidential nominee. The day <bop>he<eop> is to be announced, Majors goes to a hotel, where he meets a prostitute.
True	In 1940, he was manager for the re-election campaigns of the ``Coalition Ticket,'' three Democratic candidates backed by Memphis political boss Edward Crump: Governor Prentice Cooper, U.S. Senator Kenneth McKellar, and Commissioner of Railroads and Public Utilities Porter Dunlap. His service to the party having earned him Crump's support, on January 8, 1941, the Tennessee General Assembly elected <bop>Carr<eop> to the position of Secretary of State by a unanimous vote. <bop>He<eop> was to serve in that office longer than any other Tennessee Secretary of State, serving on three different occasions for a total of almost 27 years.

After <bop>his<eop> trade (which also included <bop>Ralph Terry<eop>, Woody Held, and Bob Martyn) to the Kansas City Athletics (see Altercations below), Martin's career declined, with several short stints with six different teams over the final 4* seasons of his playing career: the Athletics, the Detroit Tigers, the Cleveland Indians, the Cincinnati Reds, the Milwaukee Braves and the Minnesota Twins.
False	Kevin Park (born September 2, 1964 in Hythe, Alberta) is a Canadian curler from Edmonton, Alberta. Park was a two time provincial junior champion in his native Alberta, winning in 1983 and 1984. Park played third for <bop>Kevin Martin<eop> from 1990 to 1995. During this time, <bop>he<eop> won the Brier in 1991 and a silver medal at the World Curling Championships.
False	The juvenile lead was successively played by James Ellison, Russell Hayden, George Reeves, Rand Brooks and Jimmy Rogers. George Hayes (later to become known as ``Gabby'' Hayes) originally played Cassidy's grizzled sidekick, Windy Halliday. After Hayes left the series because of a salary dispute with producer <bop>Harry Sherman<eop>, <bop>he<eop> was replaced by the comedian Britt Wood as Speedy McGinnis and finally by the veteran movie comedian Andy Clyde as California Carlson.
False	She returns to the UK to speak to supporters of Santa Maria and re-connect with old friends. Hebblethwaite has written several books, including: Motherhood and God, Finding God in All Things, Base Communities: An Introduction, Paraguay: Brandt Travel Guides and Conversations on Christian Feminism, co-written with academic <bop>Elaine Storkey<eop>. <bop>She<eop> knows Pope Francis since meeting him in Buenos Aires and has had regular dealings with him, having conversed with him in pews after Sunday mass.
True	This story was the start for the Secret Defenders ongoing series. In Wolverine #148 (January 2000) the team comes back together during the Ages of Apocalypse reality to fight Arnim Zola, Blastaar and Annihilus with all four members wearing the popular blue FF costumes and the <bop>Hulk<eop> frequently switching between <bop>his<eop> various personalities.
True	William, who became emperor after Frederick's death, shared none of his parent's liberal ideas; his mother viewed him as a ``complete Prussian''. This difference in ideology created a rift between William and his parents, and relations between them were strained throughout their lives. When <bop>his<eop> father succeeded to the Prussian throne as King William I on 2 January 1861, <bop>Frederick<eop> became the Crown Prince.
False	Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene. Adam thought <bop>Ciceri<eop>'s backdrop for Act I was ``not so good ... it is all weak and pale'' but <bop>he<eop> liked the set for Act II: ``(Ciceri's) second act is a delight, a dark humid forest filled with bulrushes and wild flowers, and ending with a sunrise, seen at first through the trees at the end of the piece, and very magical in its effect.''
True	Instead of returning to her tomb at the end of the ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale. At last, on Monday, 28 June 1841 the curtain rose on Giselle at the Salle Le Peletier. Grisi danced <bop>Giselle<eop> with Lucien Petipa as <bop>her<eop> lover Albrecht, Jean Coralli as the gamekeeper Hilarion, and Ad*le Dumil*tre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis.
False	1959 also saw the release of the Hollywood film Green Mansions, set in a South American jungle and based on a 1904 best seller by the writer and naturalist, W. H. Hudson. It was directed by Mel Ferrer and starred Anthony Perkins and Audrey Hepburn as Rima the bird girl. The credits list ``Primitive music courtesy of Pierre Gaisseau and <bop>Alan Lomax<eop>.'' In 1959-60 Gaisseau embarked on the New Guinea expedition documented in <bop>his<eop> most celebrated film, Le Ciel et la boue (The Sky Above and the Mud Below).
False	He was originally determined to have died from 9/11 dust. However, the City medical examiner asserted that Zadroga died from self-injection of drugs. On the other hand, a third doctor backs the original claim of WTC dust responsibility. James' father, <bop>Joseph<eop>, said that the medical examiner reported no ``track marks on <bop>his<eop> arms or body.'')
True	The appeals court said that Whitman had based her information on contradictory information and statements from President Bush. The U.S. Department of Justice had argued that holding the agency liable would establish a risky legal precedent because future public officials would be afraid to make public statements. Judge Deborah Batts had previously declined to dismiss <bop>Whitman<eop> as a defendant, saying that <bop>her<eop> actions were ``conscience-shocking''.
True	Dalton noted flaws in the film but said that beside them, A Field in England is a rich, strange, hauntingly intense work from a highly original writer-director team.'' Peter Debruge of Variety called A Field in England ``a defiantly unclassifiable cross-genre experiment... that simultaneously reinvents and regurgitates low-budget British cinema as it goes''. Debruge said of the director's approach, ``Clearly, <bop>Wheatley<eop> is bored with the paint-by-numbers approach of <bop>his<eop> horror contemporaries, but has swung so far in the opposite direction here, the result feels almost amateurishly avant garde at times, guilty of the sort of indulgences one barely tolerates in student films.''
False	He began formal training at the age of 9 where he studied at Norma's Academy of Dance under the direction of the late Norma B. Mitchell and her daughter Djana Bell. In 1984, Payne went to Northside School of the Arts, and studied under the direction of <bop>William G Densmore<eop> and performed in Atlanta's Showbiz Kids. <bop>He<eop> then joined the Harrison Dance company under the direction of Gary Harrison before moving to Los Angeles where he soon met longtime personal idols Kenny Ortega, Michael Peters, Debbie Allen, and Paula Abdul.
True	Nonetheless, the problems began when the leaders could not agree where the center of power of this union would be located. Many of the leaders would soon figure that this union would not happen, and many (such as Jos* de San Mart*n) went back to their regular lives in disappointment. Yet, in order to expand <bop>his<eop> personal dream of Gran Colombia, <bop>Bol*var<eop> allowed Sucre to form the nation of Bolivia in Upper Peru.
False	He is the son of Toronto Maple Leafs hockey mogul Harold Ballard. Bill Ballard was a founder of Concert Productions International (familiarly, CPI), a major promoter of rock concerts and tours in North America.

True	Max reached the last 16 of the 2007 Winmau World Masters, with notable wins over Brian Woods and 2006 British Open finalist Mark Barilli before losing to Ted Hankey. He reached the final of the 2007 Swiss Open, losing to fellow Dutchman Co Stomp*.

False	She remained secretive about her poetry until much later in her life, when she was encouraged to publish under her own name. While residing at court, Anne Kingsmill also met Colonel Heneage Finch, the man who would become her husband. A courtier as well as a soldier, Colonel Finch had been appointed Groom of the Bedchamber to <bop>James<eop>, Duke of York, in 1683. <bop>His<eop> family had strong Royalist connections, as well as a pronounced loyalty to the Stuart dynasty, and his grandmother had become Countess of Winchilsea in 1628.
False	She goes on to acknowledge that in Finch's work, ``Now and again words issue of pure poetry...It was a thousand pities that the woman who could write like that, whose mind was turned to nature, and reflection, should have been forced to anger and bitterness.'' Woolf goes on in defence of her as a gifted but sometimes understandably misguided example of women's writing. It is evident that Woolf sympathises deeply with <bop>Finch<eop>'s plight as a female poet, and though <bop>she<eop> takes issue with some of the content in Finch's writing, she expresses grief that Finch is so unknown: ``...when one comes to seek out the facts about Lady Winchilsea, one finds, as usual, that almost nothing is known about her.''
True	While his back-up vocalists Gloria Jones and Yvonne Keeley are without doubt talented singers, their place in the plan is strange: the way they're used is just years out of date.'' Len Righi of The Morning Call spoke of the song, stating: ``One of the best things about the song is Jo Partridge's guitar work.'' In a retrospective review of Hobo with a Grin for <bop>his<eop> website, <bop>George Starostin<eop> said: ``...''

True	The royalties from the performances of the work allowed Gade to found a charity to help young Danish musicians, called Jacob Gade's Legat. Harry James recorded a version in 1946 (released in 1947) on Columbia 37218. As ``Jalousie'' the song was released on a single in 1951 by Frankie Laine with <bop>Paul Weston<eop> & <bop>his<eop> Orchestra (Columbia Records catalog number 4-39585).
False	Note that different sources use different sequence numbers for some of the Counts. For consistency across sources, dates of birth and death are useful. Emicho of Leiningen helped lead the German Crusade, 1096. His relationship to the others is unclear. Emich I was Count of <bop>Leiningen<eop> in 1127, but it is unclear when <bop>he<eop> died, or his relation to the other counts.

Bloomberg had recently left the Republican Party, and speculation arose that <bop>he<eop> discussed the possibility of Boren joining him as a running mate.

True	The program's first episode faced significant criticism, particularly for eliding First Nations and Acadian history in favour of treating the establishment of New France as the primary starting point to Canadian history. A number of politicians in Quebec also criticized the program's portrayal of New France as inaccurate, including the depiction of Samuel de Champlain as dirty and unkempt in a diplomatic meeting with the Wendat, even while <bop>James Wolfe<eop> was portrayed as clean in the middle of <bop>his<eop> physical climb up Cap Diamant.
False	After the 1980 elections he became Minister for Communications. In May 1982, he became Minister for Defence, a post he held until the defeat of the Fraser government at the 1983 election.

False	A prodigious ball-winner and noted passer of the ball, John reached (but lost) the FA Cup Final with Arsenal in 1926-27, after a mistake by his compatriot and close friend Dan Lewis; it was John who consoled Lewis after the final whistle, assuring him he would get another chance to a win a medal (although Lewis never did). John remained in the Arsenal side through the first half of the 1930s, despite competition from the likes of <bop>Charlie Jones<eop>. <bop>He<eop> finally won some silverware with an FA Cup win in 1929-30, followed by three First Division titles, in 1930-31, 1932-33 and 1933-34.

True	Wheatley (Carlo De Mejo), appears to recognize him. but Norman claims he is mistaken.

True	The contents of each collection are drawn from academic journal articles, conference proceedings, Festschrifts, and similar sources that may otherwise be difficult to access because they were printed in obscure journals, are out of print, or available only in specialist libraries. Each volume also allows the development of a scholar's ideas on a particular topic to be seen over time.

Newton referred to his plans for a second edition in correspondence with Flamsteed in November 1694: Newton also maintained annotated copies of the first edition specially bound up with interleaves on which he could note his revisions; two of these copies still survive: but <bop>he<eop> had not completed the revisions by 1708, and of two would-be editors, Newton had almost severed connections with one, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, and the other, <bop>David Gregory<eop> seems not to have met with Newton's approval and was also terminally ill, dying later in 1708.
True	Everest Disaster, Jon Krakauer describes the effects of HACE upon Dale Kruse, a forty-four-year-old dentist and one of the members of Scott Fischer's team: ``Kruse was having an incredibly difficult time simply trying to dress himself.

False	On 3 January 2008, after failing to establish himself in Blackpool's Championship side, Forbes signed an 18-month contract with Football League One club Millwall despite recently being managed by Kenny Jackett who released him at Swansea City over a year earlier. Forbes however only played 13 times for the club and struggled to establish himself as a first team player. Forbes signed for Grimsby Town, managed by <bop>Mike Newell<eop>, on 2 February 2009, signing on loan until the end of the 2008-2009 season.

Bernini<eop>'s program, one of <bop>his<eop> last large projects, called for ten angels holding instruments of the Passion: he personally only finished the two originals of the Angel with the Superscription ``I.N.R.I.'' and the Angel with the Crown of Thorns, but these were kept by Clement IX for his own pleasure.

Despite having been shot twice in the chest by Welch, <bop>Halberstam<eop> told <bop>his<eop> wife to get into their car, and he drove them toward Sibley Hospital.
False	He eventually became a full-time professional in October 1956 and made an impressive debut against Leicester City, during which he scored Town's second in a 2--2 draw. It was the start of a long and distinguished career at Leeds Road. Despite spending <bop>his<eop> entire Town career in the Second Division, McHale had the privilege of playing alongside some of the club's great names including <bop>Vic Metcalfe<eop>, Les Massie and Bill McGarry.
True	The measure was subsequently passed by a large margin in the House and signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Governor Hutchinson.

True	Fleming continued as a Member of Parliament (MP) in 1601, this time representing a Cornish constituency, but his maiden speech on 20 November of that year was a disaster and Fleming broke down; he never addressed the House of Commons again.

True	Afterward, Sally tells Jimmy she likes him, but he is in love with Angela, who in turn is infatuated with Army surgeon Major Hilary Jarret.

On <bop>her<eop> 18th birthday, orphan <bop>Angela Rutherford<eop> is given an inheritance of $6000.
False	Ghurni clay models have won medals and certificates at international exhibitions. Some of the Ghurni artists have studied in art colleges in France and Italy, but theirs is a talent passed down through generations. Kartik Chandra Pal prepared clay models of statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore. Based on <bop>his<eop> clay models bronze castings were made and have found pride of place in Washington DC and Moscow and were inaugurated by <bop>Bill Clinton<eop> and Mikhail Gorbachev, respectively.
True	Flanagan continued his spell in the first team to cover for the long term injuries of Martin Kelly and Glen Johnson, making his second start the following weekend and playing the full match in a 1-1 draw at the Emirates Stadium against Arsenal, a game in which he accidentally knocked out stand-in captain Jamie Carragher through a clash of heads. The incident did not faze the 18 year old as he gave an assured performance. In the following home match against Birmingham City, alongside fellow Liverpool Academy Graduate Jack Robinson, <bop>Flanagan<eop> again played the full 90 minutes and helped Liverpool to keep a clean sheet in a 5-0 win. <bop>His<eop> performance earned him a place in BBC Sport pundit Garth Crooks 's Premier League team of the week.
True	Though Dr. Coscioni was not elected to Chamber of Deputies, he received the support of hundreds of scientists, physicians, patients as well as politicians and intellectuals. Later in that year, a similar show of support accompanied his unsuccessful bid to become a member of the National Bioethics Committee.

True	Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler was founded in 1882, at the initiative of a group of dissatisfied students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, as a reaction to the outdated teachings at the Academy.

True	He then announced that CMU will celebrate Pausch's impact on the world by building and naming after Pausch a raised pedestrian bridge to connect CMU's new Computer Science building and the Center for the Arts, symbolizing the way Pausch linked those two disciplines.

False	Then a couple of weeks later and still injured, she lost in straight sets to the same player in the first round of the 2003 French Open. It was the only time she ever lost a first-round match at a Grand Slam. She never again played an official tour match.

Despite losing both matches, <bop>she<eop> played competitively and announced that she could return to the game early in 2006; however, she did not do so.
False	And often (what) adds a tremendous amount of comedy is the choosing to look over there and see what that person thinks and back and forth. He's definitely a hidden character on the show.'' In an April 2007 blog post for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery, who plays <bop>Meredith Palmer<eop>, called Jim's impression of Dwight ``one of the funniest scenes that I have ever witnessed.'' <bop>She<eop> recalled that Krasinski and Wilson enjoyed filming the scene, and that the whole cast was laughing during it, necessitating many takes.
True	The scene was first intended for the season's twenty-second episode, ``Women's Appreciation'', before it was moved to ``Product Recall'' due to time constraints. The third season DVD contains several scenes that were deleted from the final cut of the episode. These include Kelly annoyingly answering calls with the same response, Dwight contacting CNN, Kelly training the accountants, <bop>Creed<eop> admitting that <bop>he<eop> faked his own death for tax reasons, Michael explaining his apology to angry business owner Barbara Allen, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Kelly arguing, Jim talking to a high school student, and more scenes of Michael filming his apology video.

False	Overhearing Rito's denial of Nemesis' harem proclamation as student council president in chapter 75, Haruna defends him from the mob and while hiding in a gym storage she finally spoken her love to him, which he returns them. In the end of chapter 76, as Rito decides not to go forward on this, <bop>Haruna<eop> accepts and decides to wait for <bop>his<eop> answer.
False	He realizes what has occurred, and stumbles blindly into a closet, and then walks out into his family home, just as Kate, his friend, has returned to his home and, upon hearing noises from the closets, was about to open the door herself. Tim drags Kate back to the hotel, where they find the empty bath; this time with blood on the side. Kate begins thinking that Tim might've harmed <bop>Jessica<eop>; but Tim angrily denies it. Frustrated at Tim's refusal to tell <bop>her<eop> what is really wrong with him, Kate claims that the person Tim saw in her house was in fact her deaf father.
True	Ten were honoured for their role in the operation, seven receiving Distinguished Service Medals, two the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and one, the grievously wounded Ritchie, the Victoria Cross. Ritchie had not initially been recommended for this award; the recommendation being submitted at a later date by an unidentified figure in the Admiralty. Snelling speculates that the Admiralty's change of heart was possibly a morale boosting measure, although <bop>Ritchie<eop>'s courage during the action was never called into question. The shrapnel and bullet wounds <bop>he<eop> sustained in the raid were extensive, including injuries to his forehead, left thumb, left arm (twice), right arm, right hip and a badly broken right leg after being hit by two large calibre machine gun bullets.
False	But if you are looking for stand-alone songs that uplift and encourage, this album was made for you to enjoy.'' Joshua Andre, giving the album four stars at 365 Days of Inspiring Media, writes, ``Wearing his heart on his sleeve with <bop>his<eop> authenticity and transparency, Jeremy's debut offering of 12 songs, sung in a variety and slew of musical genres, is deserving of many listens as we are presented with a man on fire for <bop>Jesus<eop>, unashamed of the gospel, declaring His love and devotion for Jesus and drawing people to Christ in his unique, vibrant, honest and heartfelt way.''
False	They enjoyed success in England, as well as touring in Australia and New Zealand until 1956, when Len wished to turn his own attentions to television and the team parted. From that point Smoothey used his own name appearing as a solo comic.

True	In order to pass the time by, Starr and Cole decided to watch a movie. Half way through the movie, things began to slowly heat up. Cole then started leaning in closer towards <bop>Starr<eop>, though <bop>she<eop> wasn't quite sure how to react.
False	He recovered a fumble against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, which was later converted into a score. In an ``improved'' Ottawa squad's rematch against Hamilton, Ladygo, Joe Moss, and Avatus Stone played 55 of the 60-minute game, and the Ottawa Citizen appraised that ``they were all immense.''

True	He recorded only one album for Abbott, 1955's Jim Reeves Sings (Abbott 5001). Eventually he tired of the novelty category, and contracted with the RCA Victor company instead. During 1955, Reeves was signed to a 10-year recording contract by Steve Sholes, who produced some of Reeves' first recordings at RCA and signed Elvis Presley for the company that same year. For <bop>his<eop> earliest RCA recordings, <bop>Reeves<eop> was still singing with the loud style of his first recordings, considered standard for country and western performers at that time.
True	Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the wasted vote mindset. Republicans, including Vice President Dan Quayle, blamed <bop>Perot<eop> for their defeat, claiming that <bop>he<eop> won votes that would have otherwise gone to Bush.
False	In the drama series Underbelly Tony Mokbel is played by actor Robert Mammone. It has been alleged that in late 2002 there was a meeting of more than 10 organised criminals in Carlton. At that meeting it is said that Mokbel was beaten, nearly to death, by Nik 'The Russian' Radev 's bodyguard, West Australian <bop>Troy Mercanti<eop>, who was a member of the Coffin Cheater motorcycle gang.

False	The album is dedicated to the memory Michael F. Cergizan, who was a member of bassist Doug McCombs', and John Herndon's (both current members of Tortoise) band ``Simple.'' in 1988. The song ``Cornpone Brunch'' begins with a sample of the ``Wonderful Radio Jingle'' at the beginning of The Who Sell Out. In <bop>his<eop> review for Allmusic, Glenn Swan states ``Here, multi-instrumentalists <bop>John McEntire<eop>, Dan Bitney, John Herdon, Douglas McCombs, and Bundy K. Brown share equal responsibility and trust in each other, pouring out a thick stew of meditative grooves, light production experiments, and rusty guitar-string ambience -- the likes of which have rarely sounded so approachable, but this is not to say the album is a sellout leap into commercialism.
True	Tullus Hostilius (r. 673--642 BC) was the legendary third king of Rome. He succeeded Numa Pompilius and was succeeded by Ancus Marcius. Unlike <bop>his<eop> predecessor, <bop>Tullus<eop> was known as a warlike king.

True	Zhang Tianxi ended the practice of using Emperor Min of Jin's era name Jianxing and instead started using the current era name of Jin Dynasty (at the time, Emperor Ai's Shengping), to show even greater affinity with Jin.

True	Immediately after Blackwood's penalty, wide receiver Charlie Brown's 26-yard reception advanced the Redskins to the Dolphins 16-yard line. After calling their final timeout with 14 seconds left, Washington made one last attempt to score a touchdown before trying a field goal. Theismann's subsequent pass was caught by <bop>Garrett<eop>, but <bop>he<eop> was tackled at the 9-yard line by defensive back Glenn Blackwood, preventing any possible field goal attempt as the Redskins were unable to stop the clock before time expired in the half.

Thulsa Doom is the only non-humorous band he has been involved with. Black Debbath stole the Spellemannprisen award for best metal album from The Kovenant in 1999 as a joke in collaboration with Kristopher Schau, their friend, who presented the award.

False	In 1800, whilst still a probationary student in his first year, Westall was approached by Sir Joseph Banks to serve as landscape and figure painter to a voyage of exploration under Matthew Flinders. The position had first been offered to Julius Caesar Ibbetson, who declined; and then William Daniell, but accepted but subsequently pulled out. Daniell was a fellow student of Westall, and was engaged to one of Westall's stepsisters, so it seems likely that Westall prevailed upon <bop>Daniell<eop> to recommend <bop>him<eop> as his replacement; however one source states that Westall was recommended by Benjamin West, President of the Royal Academy.
True	On 9 December 2010 Fern*ndez was questioned as a witness in relation to Operation Galgo, an investigation into a Spanish athletics doping ring being carried out by the Guardia Civil.

True	Most notable, however, is Brynner's first film role; he plays Vicola with sleek menace and self-assured evil (and with a full head of hair, too, I might add).

Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing, ``An unknown <bop>Yul Brynner<eop>, with all <bop>his<eop> hair, in his first film role, plays a well-spoken, smug narcotics smuggler named Paul Vicola.

Despite Harriet's humble origins, <bop>Emma<eop> admires <bop>her<eop> sweetness, good nature, and pleasant looks.
False	But the Jewish men of letters who lived in Alexandria were by no means satisfied with the idea that Moses acquired the wisdom of the Egyptians; they claimed for him the merit of having given to Egypt, Phoenicia, and Hellas all their culture. He taught the Jews the letters, and they then became the teachers of the Phoenicians and, indirectly, of the Greeks, says Eupolemus. Artapanus of Alexandria, in <bop>his<eop> history of the Jews, went so far as to identify Moses with Tot-Hermes (the Egyptian messenger and scribe of the gods, who invented the letters, the various arts of peace and of war, as well as philosophy), and with the Greek Musaeus, ``the teacher of <bop>Orpheus<eop>.''

False	He was released by Crystal Palace at the end of the 2004--05 without playing for the first-team and joined Oldham Athletic on a non-contract basis in November 2005 to provide cover for an FA Cup tie against Chasetown in which he made a substitute appearance. He then joined Shrewsbury Town on non-contract terms in February 2006 to provide cover for regular goalkeeper Joe Hart. Cronin left Shrewsbury in April 2006, and after a trial with Grimsby Town, joined Gravesend and Northfleet (now Ebbsfleet United) to cover a long-term injury to regular goalkeeper <bop>Craig Holloway<eop>. After a good start to <bop>his<eop> first season at Ebbsfleet, Cronin was called up for the England National Game XI (now the England C team) squad for the first time in November 2006, and made his debut against Holland as a substitute nine minutes from time as England won the European Challenge Trophy.

The latter informed the voters that <bop>he<eop> did not think himself qualified to represent them in Parliament, but he would ``at least give them an honest vote'' (in the House).

False	Under Haysbert, Parks Sausage became the supplier for such restaurant chains as Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut.

True	Ayaan Hirsi Ali is not one of them,'' she added.

True	This myth of the city's origin was significant in ancient Roman mythology because Pallantium became one of the cities that was merged later into ancient Rome, thereby tying Rome's origins to the ancient Greek heroes.

Virgil states that Evander named the city in honor of <bop>his<eop> son, Pallas, although Pausanias as well as Dionysius of Halicarnassus say that <bop>Evander<eop>'s birth city was Pallantium, and thus he named the new city after the one in Arcadia.

False	The other producers sought to ignore Roddenberry's ongoing dalliances, but Justman drew a line at acting as his alibi.

True	One can't buy ready-mixed KCN. Nancy Pearl, Book Lust -- When Stout is on top of his game, which is most of the time, his diabolically clever plotting and his storytelling ability exceed that of any other mystery writer you can name, including <bop>Agatha Christie<eop>, who invented <bop>her<eop> own eccentric genius detective Hercule Poirot.

False	The etching was published in Antwerp in 1649 and was inserted into Topographia Bohemiae, Moraviae et Silesiae (Topographia Germaniae), published 1650. He left shortly after to create another perspective, his great view of London in 1647.

In 1636 with <bop>his<eop> new patron, <bop>Thomas Howard<eop>, he returned briefly from German lands to Prague and then went to England.
True	Return to Peyton Place is a 1959 novel by Grace Metalious, a sequel to her best-selling 1956 novel Peyton Place.

False	Coman also worked as Vice President of Public Relations for Free Speech Activist, Larry Flynt, President of Larry Flynt Publications.

False	Fresh confusion, climax of Isabella's despair: suddenly from the back is heard Brighella's burlesque cry for help; himself entangled in the coils of jealousy, he has seized the disguised State-holder by mistake, and thus leads to the latter's discovery. Friedrich is unmasked; Marianne, clinging to his side, is recognised. Amazement, indignation, joy: the necessary explanations are soon got through ; Friedrich moodily asks to be led before the judgment-seat of the <bop>King<eop> on <bop>his<eop> return, to receive the capital sentence;
True	For the latter Luzio lies in wait: he soon detects him in a stealthy masker, whose path he bars, and as Friedrich tears himself away he is about to follow him with shouts and drawn rapier, when by direction of Isabella, concealed among the bushes, he himself is stopped and led astray. Isabella comes forth, rejoicing in the thought of having restored <bop>Marianne<eop> to <bop>her<eop> faithless mate at this very moment, and in the possession of what she believes to be the stipulated patent of her brother's pardon; she is on the point of renouncing all further revenge when, breaking open the seal by the light of a torch, she is horrified at discovering an aggravation of the order of execution, which chance and bribery of the gaoler had delivered into her hands through her wish to defer her brother's knowledge of his ransom.
False	At the legislative elections of October 6, 2002, the party won 26 out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 3 out of 81 seats in the Senate.

False	He used a traditional guitar style to play modern-based compositions in an extended way. And his liner notes were way cool. ' The press garnered by Death Chants was enough to get Fahey his first paying gig--a weeklong engagement at Boston's Odyssey Coffeehouse in the summer of '65.'' In <bop>his<eop> 1992 article ``Reinventing the Steel'' for Acoustic Guitar, Dale Miller described the liner notes that <bop>Fahey<eop> began including on his releases as ``hilarious yet profound and somewhat disturbing phony folklorical ramblings that spoofed the pedantic notes on many folk releases of the day.''
False	Hardy Har Har, Atom Ant, Squiddly Diddly, Top Cat, Benny the Ball, and Yakky Doodle are voiced by John Stephenson, Don Messick, Daws Butler, and Walker Edmiston here. It was presumed that Mel Blanc, Paul Frees, Howard Morris, Arnold Stang and Jimmy Weldon weren't available to voice them for this TV movie, while Benny's voice actor <bop>Maurice Gosfield<eop> had died in 1964. In fact with <bop>his<eop> Daws Butler voice, Top Cat sounded just like Hokey Wolf.
False	The 2017 Daytona 500 was first time the ``stage format'' was used in the Daytona 500; it was set up in three stages similar to the all star race (but without the requirement to pit), where drivers are given an chance to pit if they wish to do so. Kyle Busch won the first stage earning <bop>him<eop> ten points in the new points format, Kevin Harvick won the second stage and <bop>Kurt Busch<eop> won the final stage in a dramatic last lap pass (passing Kyle Larson who ran out of gas) to win the race.

False	He was renamed Don Charles to avoid potential confusion with Tony Bennett, and released his biggest seller ``Walk With Me My Angel'' in January 1962. Written by Geoff Goddard, and produced by Meek, the single just made the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. Not that he knew it at the time, but lack of further chart activity, would leave Charles with the one-hit wonder tag. <bop>He<eop> appeared on several teen based television program mes, and released a cover version of <bop>Ben E. King<eop> 's hit ``The Hermit of Misty Mountain'' in 1962, and the country music influenced novelty ``It's My Way of Loving You'' the same year.

False	Kitty Empire of The Observer called ``Photograph'' a ``swelling ballad'', and suggested that Sheeran's writing was ``particularly calculated''. In his review for MusicOMH, John Murphy also felt that ``Photograph'' was ``calculated and a bit cynical, almost as if it's been written specifically as a soundtrack to a particularly emotional scene in a US television series''. On <bop>her<eop> analysis of the lyrical content of the album, Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club expressed that <bop>Sheeran<eop>'s ``self-awareness extends to the rest'' of the album by tackling homesickness in ``Photograph'', for instance.

The experiences of writing Invisible Man and of vaulting on <bop>his<eop> first try ``over the parochial limits of most Negro fiction'' (as Richard G.

False	The premise of Dempsey and Makepeace is the oddball pairing of two police detectives: an elegant British noblewoman, Sgt (Lady) Harriet Makepeace, and a streetwise working-class New Yorker, Lt James Dempsey, both working for an elite and armed unit of the London Metropolitan Police.

True	It was around this time that Costa started experimenting with combinations of instruments, producing musical arrangements, and peddling them to a few notable big band s.

Along with <bop>his<eop> 31 stolen bases, Braun became only the 2nd Brewer ever to have a 30-homer, 30-steal season, joining <bop>Tommy Harper<eop>, who accomplished the feat in 1970.

True	Though as the writing of the libretto progressed, certain versions showed Grimes' relations with his apprentice to be paederastic, Pears persuaded Slater to cut the questionable stanzas from the final version.

False	Francis I of France restored its usual name early in the 16th century and it then took the nickname ``le bistourn*'' (``the twice-turned (church)''), later bowdlerised into ``le bestourn*'', possibly to bring it back closer to its old name. One of the church's chaplains was Guillaume de Villon, tutor to Fran*ois Villon, and <bop>Charles Perrault<eop> was buried in the church.

False	This was done in-order to reach the international community without much problem, as most of the TYO members were born and bred there.

True	Based on the historical findings of the Terman study and on biographical examples such as Richard Feynman, who had an IQ of 125 and went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics and become widely known as a genius, the current view of psychologists and other scholars of genius is that a minimum level of IQ, no lower than about IQ 125, is strictly necessary for genius; but that level of IQ is sufficient for development of genius only when combined with the other influences identified by Cox's biographical study: opportunity for talent development along with the characteristics of drive and persistence. <bop>Charles Spearman<eop>, bearing in mind the influential theory that <bop>he<eop> originated of conceiving intelligence as made up of a ``general factor'' as well as ``special factors'' more specific to particular mental tasks, may have summed up the research the best when he wrote in 1927, ``Every normal man, woman, and child is, then, a genius at something, as well as an idiot at something.''

False	She is the only American woman to have won the Olympic title without ever having won either a World or U.S. senior national title. Hughes meets President George W. Bush on April 12, 2002. After her Olympic win, Hughes was honored with a parade in her hometown of Great Neck. Senator Hillary Clinton spoke at the event and declared it <bop>Sarah Hughes Day<eop>. <bop>She<eop> received the James E.
False	On May 25, 2009, Hughes graduated from Yale and received a bachelor's degree in American studies with a concentration in U.S. politics and communities.

Although glad to see Milly again, Gene is distraught to learn that his father is now destitute after his cattle were secretly stolen by Parker. After paying all of <bop>his<eop> father's bills, Gene learns from Milly that <bop>Arthur<eop>'s cattle have been grazing in a distant meadow, and when Gene investigates, he is captured by two of Parker's henchmen.
False	Though Lassiter saves his life in ``S.E.I.Z.E. the Day'', he does not give Lassiter any thanks or credit for it. In the next episode of the season, though Lassiter, Juliet, Shawn, and Gus work together to catch a bad guy and nab <bop>him<eop> against all odds, Trout fires Lassiter and Juliet, refires <bop>Gus<eop> and Shawn, and is in turn fired himself for his recklessness in a hostage situation.
True	He enjoys teasing lifelong friend Burton Guster (Gus), a pharmaceutical representative, about Gus's eclectic interests as they drive around in a blue Toyota Echo nicknamed ``The Blueberry'' solving crimes. Head detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), playfully named ``Lassie'' by Shawn and Gus, quietly respects <bop>Shawn<eop>'s crime-solving skills, but doubts <bop>his<eop> psychic abilities and is constantly exasperated and/or infuriated by his antics.
True	He wrote the music for Nat King Cole 's 1951 No. 1 hit ``Too Young''. He died at a nursing home in North Bergen, New Jersey. He was 89 and had lived in Fort Lee, New Jersey. ``Too Young 's'' words were written by Sylvia Dee, a lyricist and longtime collaborator with <bop>Lippman<eop>. They got the idea for the song when she told <bop>him<eop> that her younger brother was getting married and she thought he was too young.
False	Hamilton and Single both work as writers for the publication, operating under the pen-names Clancy Overell and Errol Parker--alter-egos they remain in character for in nearly all public and media appearances. The idea for the site stems from an idea Hamilton originally had to create a conservative newspaper in his hometown of Mitchell, Queensland. Hamilton had grown up near <bop>Mitchell<eop> where <bop>his<eop> parents worked as graziers, before moving to Brisbane in the 1990s.
True	Rangers played a total of 52 competitive matches during the 1997--98 season. They went into the season in pursuit of a record tenth consecutive league title. The early season form of new signing Marco Negri gave the team fresh imputous but when the then manager <bop>Walter Smith<eop> announced that <bop>he<eop> would leave the club at the end of the season the side's form dipped.
True	Both men denied taking the badge. When Jude and the others stayed inside Antonessen's truck, the mob threatened them, saying ``Nigger, we can kill you.'' During this confrontation, Ryan Packard took <bop>Jude<eop> to the ground, where other off-duty officers held <bop>him<eop> down and searched him for the badge.
False	Upon <bop>her<eop> retirement as its London Advisor, the Felton Bequest commissioned from John Brack a portrait of Ursula Hoff, which it then donated to the National Gallery of <bop>Victoria<eop>.
False	As with most major gods and goddesses in Roman mythology, the literary concept of Venus is mantled in whole-cloth borrowings from the literary Greek mythology of her counterpart, Aphrodite. In some Latin mythology Cupid was the son of Venus and Mars, the god of war. At other times, or in parallel myths and theologies, Venus was understood to be the consort of Vulcan. Virgil, in compliment to <bop>his<eop> patron Augustus and the gens Julia, embellished an existing connection between Venus, whom <bop>Julius Caesar<eop> had adopted as his protectress, and Aeneas.
True	In 1977, Ellis came out of retirement to play for Canada at the world hockey championships and then decided to resume his NHL career with the Leafs in 1977--78. Punch Imlach was hired to run the Leafs for the 1979--80 season and didn't feel that <bop>Ellis<eop> was worth the money <bop>he<eop> was being paid.
True	After being the league's top scorer with SV Leo Victor with 14 goals during the 2010-2011 season, <bop>Rijssel<eop> was offered a two-week trial with Belgium's Germinal Beerschot but ultimately was not signed by the club. It was reported that Rijssel made a favorable impression with the club, particularly with <bop>his<eop> ability to adapt to the difference in the level of play between the Suriname league and the Belgian league over the two-week period, but was unable to set himself apart from the attackers already on the roster, particularly considering the poor financial situation of the club at the time.
False	The Pharisee and the Publican, baroque fresco in Ottobeuren Basilica. The parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (or the Pharisee and the Tax Collector) is a parable of Jesus that appears in the Gospel of Luke. In Luke 18:9-14, a Pharisee, obsessed by <bop>his<eop> own virtue, is contrasted with a tax collector who humbly asks <bop>God<eop> for mercy.
False	Despenser's ruthless expansion of the de Clare lordship of Glamorgan in Wales led directly to the troubles of Edward II's later reign, including a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, the defeat of the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and eventually the deposition of the king by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella in 1326. Gilbert de Clare was the son of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester, -- known as Gilbert 'the Red' -- who in 1290 married Joan of Acre, daughter of <bop>Edward I.<eop> As a condition for the marriage, the earl had to surrender all <bop>his<eop> lands to the king, only to have them returned jointly to himself and his wife for the lifetime of either.
False	Donaldson disputed the CWT fuel-air vapor explosion scenario, stating that ``In the history of aviation, there has never been an in-flight explosion in any Boeing airliner of a Jet-A kerosene fuel vapor/air mixture in any tank, caused by mechanical failure.'' Eyewitness, debris field, metallurgical, and victim injury evidence were all cited by Donaldson as proof of the missile-attack scenario. Donaldson acknowledged <bop>James Sanders<eop>' theory of an accidental shoot-down, and did not rule out U.S. Navy involvement; however, <bop>he<eop> viewed circumstantial evidence of a terrorist attack ``more compelling''.
True	Many months later, when Epic was preparing a ``Greatest Hits'' album, they had eleven cuts and asked Bobby what should be the twelfth; ``Mr. Lonely'' was his response to the question. Following its inclusion, many disc jockeys started to play it - particularly those who remembered Buddy Greco's version and how Epic had shortchanged <bop>Bobby<eop> on <bop>his<eop> own song.
False	He is also especially the one to tell Donald of the work Chinese immigrants put into building the Central Pacific Railroad. This information intrigues Donald and from that moment he begins to have dreams of helping to build the railroad as a Chinese immigrant. Larry Louie is <bop>Donald<eop>'s dance instructor. <bop>He<eop> is also known as ``The Chinese Fred Astaire.''
True	Designed in the grand Victorian style, this imposing red brick building with stucco ornaments was for many years a ``rough Irish pub'' until its gentrification in the early 2000s. In the 1980s the Princess Victoria was briefly owned by Richard Branson and run as a music venue, with singer <bop>Phil Collins<eop> filming the music videos for <bop>his<eop> songs Sussudio and One more Night on the premises.
False	His guest-starring appearance on Cimarron City led him to his starring in his own series later that year, Laramie, one of the few network television programs set in Wyoming. Patrick Kelly called <bop>Fuller<eop> to <bop>his<eop> office, that a young, unfamiliar actor realized he had done something wrong, knowing he'd be fired.
False	The new court was moved first to Neuburg, then to Heidelberg, and finally to Mannheim. The D*sseldorf court orchestra was dissolved in the process, but in 1718, many of its musicians were reinstated in the Innsbruck court orchestra headed by Greber. In 1723, after Charles Philip moved <bop>his<eop> court to Mannheim, Johann von Wilderer was appointed to serve jointly with <bop>Greber<eop> as Kapellmeister.
True	In 1976, the film was shown in Soviet Union where it was a success. Seeta and Geeta (Hema Malini in a dual role) are twin girls who were separated at birth.

False	Raised in the East End of London by a boxer father and an ambitious mother, Booth posed for such photographers as Norman Parkinson and David Bailey in the 1960s. She opened two boutiques in London. She later became a photographer herself, taking pictures of such well-known figures as David Bowie and Bianca Jagger, as well as <bop>Queen Elizabeth II<eop> and the Queen Mother. <bop>Her<eop> work has been displayed in the National Portrait Gallery and in The Sunday Times and Cosmopolitan.
False	Walsmear's only reason for proving to himself that the fairies were real, was to assuage his conscience -- to convince himself that she died as a result of seeing fairies, as opposed to her committing suicide from guilt as a result of her having an affair with Walsmear. Castle's interest in the fairies, by this time, was purely self-serving; he fancied he had made an amazing discovery in the garden and prepared to take some photographs of the garden at night, using special lighting techniques. On <bop>his<eop> way to the garden the next night, however, Castle once again ran into Paolo and Shorty, whom <bop>Walsmear<eop> hired to steal the photographs from the Templeton house.
True	Thomas continued in the Army until January 1824 when he sold out his commission. He settled on land he named ``Dagworth'' (after the farm where he was born), an estate of 2,000 acres (8.1 km*) on the Hunter River, granted to him on 21 April 1825. In a letter to <bop>her<eop> niece, Louisa, dated 2 June 1825, Thomas'' wife <bop>Christiana<eop> describes her husband: ``Uncle Thomas has very dark hair, a high forehead, dark blue eyes, rather a short nose, a small mouth with a fine set of very white teeth, which he shows very much when he laughs; a very black beard, and nice black whiskers.
True	In the 2006 European Championships in Athletics, O'Rourke finished joint second with Kirsten Bolm and behind Swedish athlete and favourite, Susanna Kallur in a time of 12.72, a new national record. Later in the same championship O'Rourke ran the first leg for the Irish 4 x 100*m relay team which included Joanne Cuddihy, Ailis McSweeney, and Anna Boyle which set a new national record of 44.38*s. In 2007 <bop>Derval<eop> went to Osaka, Japan for the World Championships and qualified for the semi-finals but finished eighth. <bop>She<eop> had encountered an injury during the early part of the season in 2007.
True	In 1997, he contended the WBO World Title fight in Nashville, narrowly losing to Henry Akinwande on points. In all, he had 26 professional fights, with 22 wins and an impressive 17 knock-outs. As Head Trainer at the Hove ABC, working alongside <bop>his<eop> old coach Dave Brown, <bop>Scott<eop> has dedicated much of his time to training fighters since he retired in 1999.
False	When Mashiro was feeling depressed due to Takumi's words, Chie suggested to Aoi to bring in Arika to cheer her up which works and pulls both out of their depression. Chie was also aware that Tomoe Marguerite was involved in numerous plots to take out <bop>Arika Yumemiya<eop> but rather than report Tomoe <bop>she<eop> orders her to stop it.
True	He marched on Wareham, the port used by Matilda's party to maintain communications with Normandy. Wareham was too strongly defended for the king to capture, so he turned towards Salisbury instead. On his way there, he occupied Wilton Abbey while waiting for reinforcements from Winchester. While King Stephen was stationed at Wilton, mustering <bop>his<eop> forces for an attack on Salisbury, Earl Robert mounted a surprise attack at sunset on 1 July 1143. <bop>Stephen<eop> attempted to break out from the siege, but his army was forced back and dispersed by a cavalry charge from Earl Robert's army.
True	Mabern learned by watching and emulating pianists Charles Thomas and Phineas Newborn, Jr. Mabern attended Douglass High School, before transferring to Manassas High School; he played with Frank Strozier, George Coleman and Booker Little at this time, but was most influenced by Newborn, Jr. In 1954, after graduating, <bop>Mabern<eop> moved to Chicago, intending to attend the American Conservatory of Music. <bop>He<eop> was unable to afford to attend music college because of a change in his parents' financial circumstances, but had private lessons there for six months and developed his reading ability by playing with trombonist Morris Ellis' big band.
False	Anne Vaux (c. 1562 -- in or after 1637) was a wealthy Catholic recusant, the third daughter of William Vaux, 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden (1535--1595) and his first wife, <bop>Elizabeth<eop>, daughter of John Beaumont of Grace Dieu, Leicester. <bop>She<eop> and her sister Eleanor Brooksby supported Catholic priests by renting houses where priests could convene safely.
True	Lapid's spy-themed literature is especially popular in Israel. She is the creator of the character Lizzy Bdihi, who is featured in six of <bop>Lapid<eop>'s thriller novels. Bdihi is a journalist at a Beersheba Local Newspaper called Hazman Darom (literally ``The Southern Times''), and in each book <bop>she<eop> stubbornly insists on dealing with a detective mystery no one asked her to solve.
False	During the championship season, she finished eighth in the all-around at States and fifteenth at Regionals. On October 22, 2014, Kwan committed to the Kentucky Wildcats women's gymnastics team.

False	Lopes Cardoso ran a time of 55.08 seconds, a season's best for him, to finish last in the seven-man heat. He was 5.17 seconds behind the heat winner, Matzinger, and 3.56 seconds behind the second-last finisher, Russian <bop>Alexey Kotlov<eop>. Lopes Cardoso's was the slowest overall in the heat round and <bop>he<eop> did not progress to the final.
False	When the first governor-general, Timothy Michael Healy retired in December 1927, James McNeill was proposed as his replacement by the Irish government of W. T. Cosgrave and duly appointed by King George V as Governor-General of the Irish Free State.

Eileen Bailey (Helen's mother) testified that Helen had been concerned that she was sleeping excessively, and about her state of mind. The prosecution stated that traces of anti-insomnia medication had been found in Bailey's body. Giving evidence in <bop>his<eop> defence, Stewart claimed that Bailey and her dog had been kidnapped on 11 April 2016 by two men called <bop>Nick<eop> and Joe, saying that he had not told the police about this ``to keep Helen safe'' and that the kidnappers had demanded a ransom of *500,000.
False	He said that he had spoken to her for the last time on a mobile phone belonging to one of the men on 15 April.

True	All her force, and it is the more tremendous for being constricted, goes into the assertion, 'I love. I hate. I suffer. '''-- Virginia Woolf. The Daily Telegraph's, Lucy Hughes-Hallett argues that Villette is greater than Bront*'s most famous work Jane Eyre. <bop>She<eop> states that the novel is ``an astonishing piece of writing, a book in which phantasmagorical set pieces alternate with passages of minute psychological exploration, and in which <bop>Bront*<eop>'s marvellously flexible prose veers between sardonic wit and stream-of-consciousness, in which the syntax bends and flows and threatens to dissolve completely in the heat of madness, drug-induced hallucination and desperate desire.''
False	The audience feels the effects of the previous notes and can reflect on that moment intentionally. Silence does not hinder musical excellence but can enhance the sounds of instruments and vocals within the piece. In his book Sound and Silence (1970), the composer John Paynter says, ``the dramatic effect of silence has long been appreciated by composers.'' <bop>He<eop> gives as an example, ``the general pause in the middle of the chorus ``Have lightnings and thunders ...'' in <bop>Bach<eop>'s St. Matthew Passion'':

True	Wilhelmina became Editor-in-Chief of Mode magazine, but that position would not last long, as she was demoted back to Creative Director after sales for the new Mode plunged, thanks in part to Alexis regaining her trust in Daniel and Betty discovering a series of letters Marc gave <bop>her<eop> on purpose after he felt betrayed by Wilhelmina's ill-fated plan to mold <bop>Betty<eop> into the next ``Wilhelmina.''
True	After she witnesses Alexis and Daniel bury the hatchet, Wilhelmina realizes Alexis has turned on her: when Alexis tells her she is keeping Daniel on board as editor-in-chief, Wilhelmina ends their partnership and now regards Alexis as an enemy. When Wilhelmina later finds out that MODE legally belongs to <bop>Claire Meade<eop>, Bradford's wife, <bop>she<eop> visits her at the hospital where Claire is detoxing for her hearing.
True	The pair shared a romantic trip together, and planned to escape together, but moments before their boat arrived, the police arrived having received a tip off that Connor was at the hotel, and realizing he had been caught, he insisted that Wilhelmina pretend that she had been the one to turn him in, in order to get her position back at Mode. Back home, Wilhelmina continues to secretly meet Connor in prison; the perks of having a Senator for a father granting her daily conjugal visits. Wilhelmina, however, pretends to Daniel that she is no longer interested in <bop>Connor<eop> but that if <bop>he<eop> re-instates her in her old capacity, she will retrieve the money from Connor, who is still in love with her.
False	In Plus None we find out that Nico didn't really kill her boyfriend, she is just trying to extort money from Wilhelmina, with her boyfriend posing as a private investigator blackmailing the Slaters. In desperation, Wilhelmina planned to flee the country with Nico, and resigned from her position at Mode effective after the upcoming ``Fearless shoot'' in the Bahamas. However, Marc later overheard <bop>Nico<eop> and her boyfriend scheming, and after initially refusing to believe <bop>him<eop>, Wilhelmina set a trap for Nico by showing her an expensive family heirloom that they could use to pay off the blackmailer.
False	Sir Alan built St Fillan's Church, which still stands, next to the castle, in around 1140, and his family probably built the original hall house in around 1200, or possibly even earlier. In 1216, another Alan de Mortimer is recorded granting land to the monks of Inchcolm Abbey. There is no record of what happened to the de Mortimers, but in the early 14th century, King Robert the <bop>Bruce<eop> granted Aberdour to <bop>his<eop> kinsman, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray (d. 1332).

True	The book itself does not identify which stories were written by whom, and although Bethan would have been happy to put her name to her work, not all the contributors were willing to do so.

True	The move was immediately denied by the NHL for obvious reasons; Wolfe had long retired from the NHL and was well into his career as a financial planner in the Washington, D.C. -metropolitan area.

While praising Wurtzel's prose style as ``sparkling'' and ``luminescent,'' <bop>Kakutani<eop> thought the memoir ``would have benefited enormously from some strict editing'' and said that its ``self-pitying passages make the reader want to shake the author, and remind <bop>her<eop> that there are far worse fates than growing up during the '70s in New York and going to Harvard.''

False	Liam (Roberto Aguire) surprises Aria (Lucy Hale) in Rosewood and Aria admits to Liam the truth about Ezra's new book after he reveals to her the writing is too similar to her own. Alison (Sasha Pieterse) explains to Spencer that she and Elliott (Huw Collins) are more than just friends, but they cannot reveal their relationship as it would be deemed ``inappropriate''. Spencer confronts Mona (<bop>Janel Parrish<eop>), who tells <bop>her<eop> that she had Yvonne leave her phone on purpose because she wanted Spencer to find the file.
False	Bowen, serving as third-lieutenant, and MacBride cruised in the Bay of Biscay, with Richard coincidentally serving under his brother James, the elder Bowen being the master of Artois.

False	At the end of 1411, Stibor, his brothers and other members of the Clan of Ostoja were in charge of leading troops to fight against the Republic of Venetia in Friuli. In 1412 Stibor was meeting with Zawisza Czarny (The Black Knight) in his Castle of Star* *ubov*a in Slovakia, preparing the negotiation between Sigismund and Polish King <bop>Vladislav Jogaila<eop>, which ended with the Treaty of Lubowla. Before <bop>his<eop> death, he set up a collegiate chapter for Augustinians in V*g*jhely (today Nov* Mesto nad V*hom in Slovakia).
False	Osborn's Iron Patriot's activities have been increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes such as when he was tricked into attacking Tony Stark (in an early Iron Man suit) and when the New Avengers led by the new Captain America (Bucky Barnes) used Iron Patriot's tracking device on Luke Cage as a trick to destroy his own house. During <bop>his<eop> invasion of Asgard on the ``claim'' of a national security threat, Osborn's Iron Patriot armor gets dismantled remotely by <bop>Stark<eop> in the middle of Osborn's fight with Steve Rogers, revealing Osborn's Green Goblin-like facepaint in fear of the Void.
False	Brock Wickersham (voiced by Tony Sampson) - A bully who enjoys pulling pranks on various characters, especially on Herbert Finkle. Budweiser ``Buddy'' Wickersham (voiced by Andrew Francis) - <bop>Brock<eop>'s younger brother who is also a bully. It is also revealed that <bop>he<eop> is a genius, but he does not want people to find out about it, especially his big brother, saying that that fact would embarrass him in front of his family.
False	He is shown to have a crush on Sincerity early in the series but his interest on her fades away by the end, instead hinting at being attracted to Mimi. Sincerity Travers (voiced by Carly McKillip) - A snobbish preppy 10 year old girl with pink hair who, sometimes, does not get along with <bop>Mimi<eop>. <bop>She<eop> and Mimi used to be friends years ago, but as they got older, their interests diverged, and they started growing apart.
True	And the Lord said to him, ``How can you say, 'I have fulfilled the Law and the Prophets', when it is written in the Law: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself', and many of your brothers, sons of Abraham, are covered with filth, dying of hunger, and your house is full of many good things, none of which goes out to them?'' And <bop>he<eop> (<bop>Jesus<eop>) turned and said to Simon his disciple, who was sitting by him, ``Simon son of John, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.''(
True	Traditionally he led the Church from Jerusalem and according to 1 Corinthians (15:7) had a special appearance of the resurrected Jesus, and only ``then to all the apostles''. Concerning its origin, Jerome relates that the Nazarenes believed that the Hebrew Gospel he received while at Chalcis was written by Matthew the Evangelist. In <bop>his<eop> work On Illustrious Men, <bop>Jerome<eop> explains that Matthew, also called Levi, composed a gospel of Christ, which was first published in Judea in Hebrew script for the sake of those of the circumcision who believed (On Illustrious Men, 2) Meanwhile, in his Commentary on Matthew, Jerome refers to the Gospel of the Nazarenes and the Gospel of the Hebrews.
True	A notable theme running through his work (most notably the 'Dead' trilogy) is agalmatophilia c male lust for young female gynoid s, as well as the darker undercurrents of British national culture. His novels and stories have links and plot overlaps between one another, and together form a mythos. His ``epic masterpiece'' (``Reading Richard Calder'', <bop>Claude Lalumi*re<eop>) is said to be Malignos (2000). <bop>He<eop> cites as inspirations Angela Carter and Georges Bataille, among others.
False	Ted Danson ultimately won the role, but Dryer later appeared as sportscaster (and former Red Sox teammate of Sam's) Dave Richards in the episodes ``Sam at Eleven'', ``Old Flames'', ``Love Thy Neighbor'', and ``'I' On Sports''. Dryer's best-known acting role came in the 1980s television crime drama <bop>Hunter<eop>, in which <bop>he<eop> costarred with Stepfanie Kramer.
True	Crime boss Rusty Pirone (Armand Assante) is about to stand trial again and Daniel Graham (Gabriel Byrne) of the district attorney's office is determined this time to put him behind bars. Pirone sends one of his henchmen, a burned-out ex-cop named Tommy Vesey (William Hurt), to threaten Valerie Alston (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer), a juror.

True	His favourite pastime is playing the ``House Rules Parcheesi'', a game which has many, very complicated rules, that is claimed to be rather opposite to Calvinball. Llewellyn married Millie's Mother at the end of the Daily Strip. Of all the characters in Ozy and Millie, <bop>Simpson<eop> has claimed that Llewellyn is <bop>her<eop> favorite.
False	Jenkins then joined the Reform Party, but Endean was selected as the party's candidate instead. Endean represented the Auckland electorates of Parnell from 1930 to 1938, and then Remuera from 1938 to 1943. When the Reform Party merged with United to form the National Party in 1936, Endean became a National Party member. <bop>He<eop> was controversial within the National Party and in the party's 50-year history written by <bop>Barry Gustafson<eop>, it is remarked that in 1938, there was ``some resistance to the National MP'' in the Remuera electorate.
False	Kenya started off solidly in their big chase, with openers Morris Ouma and Seren Waters adding 37 for the first wicket until a direct hit from Umar Akmal had the latter run out. The Kenyans fought during the first half of their innings, getting to 73/2 before Shahid Afridi bowled <bop>Steve Tikolo<eop>. <bop>He<eop> then ran through the lower middle order and the tail with ease, and ended up with figures of 5/16 from 8 overs as Kenya collapsed to 112 all out, with the only resistance offered by Collins Obuya's 47.
False	On one hand, it is possible that, following William's death, Hagrold seized control of parts of the Cotentin with foreign support, and extended his authority to Bayeux. On the other hand, Hagrold may have operated in the context of aiding the Normans of Rouen to oppose the Franks. Although he likely defended Bayeux from Louis and Hugh in 944, Hagrold's capture of <bop>Louis<eop> the following years suggests that <bop>he<eop> volunteered to assist Hugh against the king.
True	Ferrari also cast doubt on ``the arrival of technicians'' with Alonso. At the first race in Bahrain, Alonso qualified third behind team mate Massa and pole sitter Sebastian Vettel. At the start, Alonso got ahead of Massa to move up to second and later on in the race, leader Vettel had an engine problem and dropped to fourth and <bop>Alonso<eop> won the race, becoming the fifth man to win on <bop>his<eop> debut for Ferrari after Juan Manuel Fangio in 1956, Mario Andretti in 1971, Nigel Mansell in 1989, and Kimi R*ikk*nen in 2007.
False	Sonny initially throws Claudia out after Ric suggests that he may be the baby's father, but Sonny eventually allows her to stay until the baby's paternity is confirmed.

True	These feuilletons (nineteen of them) were then compiled into a book F*nf Minuten Amerika and published by Paul Zsolnay Verlag the next year, 1931. In his book, Salten provides subjective observations of American society and nature, and the main emphasis is on his personal impressions and opinions.

True	Janet believes Mike may be having an affair with his assistant, Claire Hackett (Maura McGiveney). Janet's beliefs are fueled by the Harpers' busybody landlady, Vanessa Courtwright (Hermione Baddeley), who thinks <bop>Janet<eop> can play Mike's game by entering into an affair of <bop>her<eop> own, whether it be real or made-up.
False	Hughes captained England for every one of Mercer's seven games in charge, and initially maintained the role when Don Revie was appointed as Ramsey's permanent successor. However, after the first two qualifiers for the 1976 European Championships, Revie decided to drop <bop>Hughes<eop> from the team. <bop>He<eop> gave the captaincy to his former Blackpool team-mate Alan Ball, and Hughes appeared only twice for England in 1975.
False	In 1793, the British transported him to New South Wales for life as punishment for a murder. The authorities in NSW executed Morgan for bashing Simon Raven to death in Sydney on 18 October 1796. On 30 November 1796, Morgan was hanged for the brutal murder of <bop>Simon Raven<eop>. Following <bop>his<eop> execution his body was hung in chains (gibbeting) on Pinchgut.
True	The other provinces did not recognize Lavalle as a legtimate governor, and supported the rosist resistance instead. Lavalle would be defeated a short time later at the Battle of M*rquez Bridge by the forces of Rosas and L*pez. L*pez returned to Santa Fe, which was menaced by Jos* Mar*a Paz, while Rosas kept <bop>Lavalle<eop> under siege and forced <bop>him<eop> to resign with the Ca*uelas pact.

The coroner 's report listed <bop>her<eop> death as an accidental drug overdose.
True	However, the plan did not go through because Zhuge Liang, the Chancellor of Shu, rejected Wei Yan's plan. In 228, the second Wei emperor, <bop>Cao Rui<eop>, personally led reinforcements to Chang'an to defend against a series of invasions by Shu forces under Zhuge Liang's leadership. <bop>He<eop> removed Xiahou Mao from his command and reassigned to be a Master of Writing (**) in the Wei central government in Luoyang.
False	His father, the owner of an appliance store and record shop, exposed him as a young boy to prominent jazz musicians like King Oliver and Louis Armstrong, who inspired his 2014 release, Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch. Throughout his adolescence his father's connections enabled him access to the recording rooms of burgeoning rock artists such as Little Richard and Guitar Slim. From these exposures he advanced into clubs and onto the stage with varying local artists, most notably, Professor Longhair. When <bop>he<eop> was about 13 or 14 years old, Rebennack met <bop>Professor Longhair<eop>, which started a period in his life that would mark rapid growth as a musician and the beginnings of his entry into professional music.
True	1.68 22.3 The 2006--07 campaign marked Cappie Pondexter's first campaign in Europe. She was a major contributor to the success of the Fenerbah*e Istanbul club. When <bop>her<eop> side's quarter-final match-up against Ros Casares was tied at 67, <bop>Pondexter<eop> scored the winning basket with just seconds remaining to lift Fenerbah*e to victory.
True	Yankees fan blogs, which generally bemoan the team's relief pitchers, quickly grew frustrated with the team's reluctance to place Britton on the major league roster, or use him when available. This unwillingness to use the pitcher has been dubbed ``Brittongate.'' General manager Brian Cashman expressed confidence in <bop>Britton<eop>: ``<bop>He<eop> has not failed in any capacity at any level.
False	Loretta manages to convince Steph and Frankie that Jake has been threatening her and she is afraid of him. Jake feels he has no choice but to stay with Loretta or his family will have him sectioned again. He confides in Nancy, who privately meets Adam to confirm Jake's story. When Nancy is alone, <bop>Loretta<eop> confronts <bop>her<eop> and Nancy is accidentally injured.
False	Jake feels he has no choice but to stay with Loretta or his family will have him sectioned again. He confides in Nancy, who privately meets Adam to confirm Jake's story.

False	She took over the role of Pippa Fletcher from Vanessa Downing on 23 July 1990 and continued to play the part on Home and Away until leaving in 1998, although she has frequently returned to guest star. This character was widely popular and continues to be a favourite.

True	It seems clear that they have not spoken for quite some time, and Esme is so glad to finally see her daughter again that she begins to weep as she hugs Amy. Once she has recovered, we learn that Esme has been acting as a nurse on a television show, and that Frank had been trying to marry Esme practically since the last time Amy had visited. Esme knows why <bop>Amy<eop> has come though, as <bop>her<eop> marital scandals have been all over the news since Dominic is now a ``media monolith.''
True	Amy arrives at the house looking for Esme to find Frank poring over various books and documents, Evelyn sleeping across the room in a wheelchair. Esme arrives not long after Amy, but is surprised to see her.

Once <bop>she<eop> has recovered, we learn that <bop>Esme<eop> has been acting as a nurse on a television show, and that Frank had been trying to marry Esme practically since the last time Amy had visited.
False	I'm frightened of you because you're the past.'' Act four is set in 1995, and is set backstage, in a dressing room of a small West end theater.

True	On request of England, the involved judges were recalled to the Netherlands and put on trial, but were finally (in 1632) judged to have acted lawfully. Decades later, Oliver Cromwell used embellished versions of this event, dubbed the ``Amboyna massacre'', as one of the pretexts to start both the First Anglo-Dutch war (in 1652) and the Second Anglo-Dutch War (in 1665), while <bop>John Dryden<eop> produced <bop>his<eop> tragedy Amboyna; or the Cruelties of the Dutch to the English Merchants on request of one of the English negotiators of the Secret Treaty of Dover during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

True	The magazine also listed Pam Bouvier seventh on their list of worst Bond girls, saying Carey Lowell ``fumbled this attempt at giving 007 a modern, independent counterpart by turning her into a nagging pest.'' Norman Wilner of MSN considered Licence to Kill the second worst Bond film, above only A View to a Kill, but defended <bop>Dalton<eop>, saying <bop>he<eop> ``got a raw deal.
False	Licence to Kill is one of the best of the recent Bonds.'' Jack Kroll, writing in Newsweek described Licence to Kill as ``a pure, rousingly entertaining action movie''. Kroll was mixed in his appraisal of Dalton, calling him ``a fine actor who hasn't yet stamped Bond with <bop>his<eop> own personality'', observing ``Director John Glen is the <bop>Busby Berkeley<eop> of action flicks, and his chorus line is the legendary team of Bond stunt-persons who are at their death-defying best here''.
True	At Wimbledon, she cruised into the fourth round but was upset by Coco Vandeweghe in straight set. She then lost to Petra Kvitov* in the final at New Haven.

True	No contemporary source states which of Brankovi*'s five children were also Irene's, although the youngest, Catherine, bore the name of Kantakouzenos, and Mara was ``clearly'' the daughter of one of Brankovi*'s earlier wives. Based on portraits of Irene with *ura* Brankovi* and his five children from a chrysobull preserved at the monastery of Esphigmenou on Mount Athos, dated 11 September 1429, <bop>Nicol<eop> interprets how the individuals were grouped that Stefan and Lazar were <bop>her<eop> children too.

True	He became head of the Department of Anthropology at Mexico City College, which position he held at the time of his passing on January 2, 1951. According to fellow anthropologist Charles E. Dibble, ``In the brief span of a decade, <bop>Barlow<eop> gave Middle American research an impetus and perspective of enduring consequence. <bop>His<eop> contributions in Mexican archaeology, classical and modern Nahuatl, Mexican colonial history, and what he preferred to call ''Bilderhandschriften`` are of lasting importance.''

False	Cheryl is allowed out of hospital for a day visit and comes face to face with Marlene (who had purchased Number 24 from Madge Bishop (Anne Charleston)) after more than a quarter century. The meeting between the two women is frosty to begin with but Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies) convinces Cheryl to make up with <bop>Marlene<eop>, as <bop>she<eop> never had the chance to make up with her mother, Fiona (Suzanne Dudley) before she died.
True	Cheryl was born to Hector and Marlene Kratz (Moya O'Sullivan) in 1950. When Cheryl was eleven years old, Marlene left Hector to raise her and her brother, Patrick (Shane Porteous). Cheryl then grew up hating and resenting <bop>Marlene<eop>, even believing <bop>her<eop> to be dead.

True	Elinor is described as possessing a coolness of judgement and strength of understanding which qualifies her to be her mother's frequent counsellor, and sometimes she shows more common sense than her mother, whose judgment is shown to be flawed by her exaggerated notions of romantic delicacy.

False	Potter was following the pattern of fairy tales by dwelling on the theme of pursuit and prey and, if there is a moral to Potter's interpretation of the theme, it tells us that an innocent, helpless, simple, or rash animal may become someone else's meal. Potter often pointed out that the tale of Jemima was a retelling of ``Little Red Riding Hood''. Perrault's tale ends with the death of the heroine, but Potter understood children will not tolerate tragedy. The prey in <bop>her<eop> books survive for better or worse (Peter returns home for a dose of chamomile tea, for example) and, though <bop>Jemima<eop> loses her eggs to her hungry rescuers, she lives to return to the farm to raise a brood of ducklings.

False	As far as we can ascertain the details of the masque, the Queen of Sheba was to bring gifts to the King, representing Solomon, and was to be followed by the spirits of Faith, Hope, Charity, Victory and Peace.

True	Things go awry when Den discovers that Sharon and Dennis have resumed their affair, and in order to split them up, Den persuades Zoe to lie that she is pregnant with Dennis's baby. Unwilling to allow Dennis to leave his unborn child, Sharon leaves Walford with Vicki leaving Dennis and Zoe unhappily together. In apparent retribution towards Dennis for inadvertently being the cause of Sharon's departure, Den manipulates <bop>Zoe<eop> into having sex with him so <bop>she<eop> can get pregnant and pretend the baby is Dennis's; when Dennis catches them having sex, Den appears pleased.
