False	It is widely accepted as one of the most politically difficult portrait commissions in art history, requiring an understanding of the interplay of relationships with a depth ``worthy of Shakespeare'', in the opinion of art historians Rodolfo Pallucchini and Harold Wethey.

False	Similar ideas are found in Dylan Thomas's ``Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night'', which Williams excerpted and added as an epigraph to his 1974 version. These lines are appropriate, as Thomas wrote the poem to his own dying father. Additionally, in one of <bop>his<eop> many drafts, in a footnote on <bop>Big Daddy<eop>'s action in the third act, Williams deems Cat on a Hot Tin Roof a ``play which says only one affirmative thing about 'Man's Fate': that he has it still in his power not to squeal like a pig but to keep a tight mouth about it.''
False	Gibbons's approach to melody in both fantasias and dances features a capability for almost limitless development of simple musical ideas, on display in works such as Pavane in D minor and Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard.

False	The residents referred to this widespread destruction as ``The Burning.'' The Confederates were not idle during this period and Sheridan's men were plagued by guerrilla raids by partisan ranger Col. John S. Mosby.

False	For this reason, Aiko is the bridge between the other four, acting as friend to Arashi, reassurance to Hajiki and Takumi, and a peacemaker to Katana. The latter two are the ones she is most in touch with, and has the greater impact on. It seems that no one can really dislike <bop>Aiko<eop>. Because <bop>she<eop> saved Sayuri from being crushed by Zero in a battle, Katana holds her in slight trust, and so she tries to bring him into their sort-of group by being friendly, visiting he and Sayuri in their hideout and bringing them lunches and snacks from time to time, to show her good faith and that she's concerned.

False	The ``Tibetans'' was published by Peter Kelder in 1939, and republished in 1975. The practice was re-introduced by Christopher S. Kilham in 1994, with his publication ``The Five Tibetans''. There is little historical or cultural evidence to support Kelder's booklet. Most scholars of Tibet and authentic lineage holders state <bop>his<eop> publications are works of fiction (in the same vein as <bop>Lobsang Rampa<eop>).
True	It is widely accepted as one of the most politically difficult portrait commissions in art history, requiring an understanding of the interplay of relationships with a depth ``worthy of Shakespeare'', in the opinion of art historians Rodolfo Pallucchini and Harold Wethey. However, it was one Titian seems to have resolved; while the complexity of the relationships is all on the canvas, it may have been intended as an indicator to Charles that <bop>Paul<eop> retained <bop>his<eop> position as the dominant patriarch -- old and frail but still a man of vitality, and in control of his squabbling descendants.

False	Mike D'Angelo of The A.V. Club also praised Forster's performance and the tone of the film, saying ``If the film came across as jaded and cynical, it might well be hard to take. Instead, it seems weary and defeated, as if some people are simply born to fail.'' Conversely, Kristy Puchko of The Playlist criticized the film's humor and called it ``one note''. While <bop>she<eop> praised the performances of <bop>Daniela Sandiford<eop>, Cole, Weaver, Forster, and Healy, Puchko stated that Coster-Waldau's performance ``keeps us at a distance, unable to connect, empathize, or care''.

Hyatt later claimed that Newton was a cocaine addict, and that Newton would legitimately chip teeth and pull <bop>Hyatt<eop>'s hair out during their catfights. In 1987, <bop>she<eop> went to the National Wrestling Alliance 's (NWA) Jim Crockett Promotions where she was the valet for Four Horsemen member Tully Blanchard for over a month.
False	``I know this for a fact that the manager and the players are 100 per cent behind David Dein and I can see real repercussions coming off the back of this.'' http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/players-upset-by-deins-departure-445419.html%20 Thierry Henry claimed that <bop>David Dein<eop>'s departure as vice-chairman had dismayed <bop>him<eop> and left him in no doubt that it was time to move on.
True	Down the Road was commercially and critically one of Morrison's most successful albums. It charted higher in the U.S. than any of Morrison's albums since 1972's Saint Dominic's Preview. John Metzger of The Music Box wrote, ``every few years, <bop>Morrison<eop> manages to tap into some magical space that sums up both <bop>his<eop> career and his influence in one fell swoop ... not that they're all that groundbreaking, they're just penultimate pieces of perfection.
False	Alma Vivian Powell (n*e Johnson) (born October 27, 1937 in Birmingham, Alabama) is an American audiologist and the wife of military and political figure Colin Powell, whom she married on August 25, 1962.

False	Other regional credits include Private Lives, Full Gallop (a one-woman show portraying the famous editor of vogue, Diana Vreeland), Holiday, The Seagull, the title roles in Agnes of God and Gypsy. In addition to performing, Larson produced the cabaret revue Serious Bizness (1983). One of <bop>her<eop> proudest accomplishments was producing and appearing in Wicked & My So Called Life - a comedy revue written by <bop>Winnie Holzman<eop> and David Babcock, which ran successfully Off-Broadway for 8 months.
False	His reign is usually characterised as ``troubled'' because of the many competitors for the crown and because of the arrival of Magyar raiders in Western Europe. He was the last emperor before Otto the Great was crowned in 962, after a 38-year interregnum. His family was called the Unruochings after <bop>his<eop> grandfather, Unruoch II. Berengar was a son of Eberhard of Friuli and Gisela, daughter of <bop>Louis the Pious<eop> and his second wife Judith.
True	In his 2003 biography, Becoming Jane Austen, Jon Spence suggests that Jane Austen actually used her and Tom LeFroy's personalities as the models for Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, but not in an expected way. Spence suggests that Jane Austen used Tom Lefroy's more gregarious personality as the model for the novel's heroine <bop>Elizabeth Bennet<eop>, and <bop>her<eop> own measured demeanor was used as the model for the male protagonist, Mr.
False	Shortly after his appointment, Wells permitted Ontario schoolchildren to watch the final game of the 1972 ``Summit Series'' ice hockey tournament between Canada and the Soviet Union from their classrooms. He defeated Liberal challenger Gerry Phillips by 2,677 votes in the 1975 election, and was returned by a greater majority again in 1977. On August 16, 1978, Davis appointed <bop>Wells<eop> as <bop>his<eop> Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
False	Suzi Quatro also features in episode three, showing Lindsey some techniques on the bass guitar. As part of their final preparations the band gave a live performance in Golden Cross, Coventry. In the final episode Simmons reveals the final line-up of the band, dropping an obviously devastated Ellie and opting for <bop>Chris<eop>, who <bop>he<eop> felt was more charismatic.
False	The second generation of Romantic poets includes Lord Byron (1788--1824), Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792--1822) and John Keats (1795--1821). Byron, however, was still influenced by 18th-century satirists and was, perhaps the least 'romantic' of the three, preferring ``the brilliant wit of <bop>Pope<eop> to what <bop>he<eop> called the 'wrong poetical system' of his Romantic contemporaries''.
False	Suspending Disbelief was recorded in February and March 1993 at The Site and Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California, Russian Hill Recording in San Francisco, and Johnny Yuma Recording in Los Angeles. The album was mixed at Record One in Los Angeles. In <bop>his<eop> review for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann wrote that Suspending Belief contains <bop>Webb<eop>'s ``most straightforward, plainspoken writing yet'' and that the songwriter ``seems better able to perform his music now than at any time in the past.''

True	Five years later--again just a year after Lippmann's The Phantom Public appeared--Bernays published a second book on public relations, Propaganda. If Lippmann's prose was intended to sway the thinking of socially cognizant leaders and intellectuals, <bop>Bernays<eop>'s writing style was meant for practitioners in the trenches; <bop>his<eop> primary interest was to frame the job of public relations counsel in ways that would allow practitioners to take advantage of the insights of modern social and psychological thought.
True	In the exposition, the love theme remains shielded from the violence of the first theme. In the recapitulation, the first theme strongly influences the love theme and ultimately destroys it. By following this pattern, Tchaikovsky shifts the true musical conflict from the development section to the recapitulation, where it climaxes in dramatic catastrophe. Thanks to Balakirev as well as <bop>his<eop> own hard work, <bop>Romeo<eop> would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally.
False	Having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, Ludwig von Welden served with distinction as a staff officer in Italy in 1814, and, after the capture of Mantua, was given the task to repatriate the French army, which had capitulated there, to southern France. In 1815, Ludwig von Welden was an officer in the general staff in the army raised to confront <bop>Joachim Murat<eop>, the dethroned king of Naples. During this campaign, <bop>he<eop> was promoted to the rank of colonel and, in 1816, to that of brigadier of the Austrian engineer corps.
True	Because of this (and because everyone thinks the name of the disease is sexy) an agreement is brokered between Grant-a-Dream and NBC in which Gumbel 2 Gumbel will be put back on the air if NBC can get the film rights to Chris's death. Peter is overjoyed with Gumbel 2 Gumbel back on the air, and <bop>Chris<eop> uses <bop>his<eop> ``illness'' to his advantage in school.
False	Seventy years later all of the Moffat's lands were passed to the Johnstones due to the Moffats having massive debts. During the Civil War, the Clan Johnstone supported the Royalist cause of King Charles. In 1633, King Charles I awarded lordship to the Johnstone chief, Sir James Johnston, as the Lord Johnstone; ten years later <bop>Charles<eop> made <bop>him<eop> the Earl of Hartfell.

True	Appalled, Helmut digs into the scholar's life and travels to Austria and Italy to uncover evidence of Hopfgartner's hateful past. Meanwhile, Hopfgartner's colleague and rival, Regina Neumann, wants to reveal the truth about Hopfgartner's sexual liaisons with vulnerable students before the professor's imminent retirement. Neumann traps <bop>Sarah Goodman<eop>, an insecure graduate student trying to find <bop>her<eop> place at Yale, into initiating formal charges of sexual harassment against Hopfgartner.
True	It soon moved to Castle Hill, home of Lord and Lady Fortescue at Filleigh in North Devon until the end of the war, when in 1945 St Peters moved back to its old home in Seaford, now vacated by the Army, and resumed normal service. In 1956 Pat and Marjorie retired and <bop>Basil Talbot<eop>, an assistant Headmaster, a member of the team from the 1930s briefly took over but <bop>he<eop> retired through ill health.
False	When Janine tells Michael she wants to change Scarlett's last name to Butcher, he pins her up against the wall and puts his hands around her neck, so she has an injunction taken out, stopping him from seeing Scarlett. Michael manipulates Alice, who is <bop>Scarlett<eop>'s nanny again, telling <bop>her<eop> that he loves her, and they have sex again.
True	It ran for 53 episodes from January 20, 1991 to January 26, 1992 on TV Asahi. It is part of the Metal Hero Series franchise; a sequel to Special Rescue Police Winspector, it is the second series to follow the Rescue Hero trilogy. After the Winspector police team leaves Japan to fight crime in France, Chief <bop>Shunsuke Masaki<eop> realizes <bop>he<eop> must create a new police team to defend Tokyo from crime.
False	Descriptions of T. redivivum in John Cassin's 1856 book Illustrations of the Birds of California, Texas, Oregon, British, and Russian America led later ornithologists to conclude that at least three of the birds described were actually the crissal thrasher. When an army surgeon working in New Mexico sent Cassin specimens of a bird that <bop>he<eop> believed to be the California thrasher, Cassin sent the specimens to <bop>Spencer Baird<eop> at the Smithsonian Institution.

False	Eidos Interactive, Saboteur's publishing company, cancelled the project with the decision to abandon the PlayStation market for the next generation of consoles. This decision cancelled Saboteur and lack of funds forced Pumpkin Studios into shutting down operations. The protagonist of Saboteur is a young ninja named Shin. Shin's sister has been abducted by CyberGen Corporation, a monolithic corporation in the game's contemporary Japan setting. With <bop>his<eop> pet dog, <bop>Shiro<eop>, Shin plans to rescue his sister and exact his revenge on CyberGen.
True	The twenty-five-and-a-half-minute production was written and directed by Buffy creator Joss Whedon, and was expanded upon and re-shot for the first episode of the series. It is notable for featuring a different actress in the role of Willow, Sunnydale High is Berryman High and a different actor as Principal Flutie. After having burned down <bop>her<eop> school gym and been expelled from a school in L.A., <bop>Buffy Summers<eop> has moved to Sunnydale with her mother.

True	Dan has spent the summer assisting a famous author (guest star Jay McInerney), and clearly still has one certain girl on his mind, which results in him going after her. While interning for Eleanor Waldorf's company, <bop>Jenny<eop> sneaks a coveted invite to the Hamptons' white Party at which Eric introduces <bop>her<eop> to socialite Tinsley Mortimer.
False	Michael, seeing that Jean is an easy target, decides to con her again by asking her for a second investment by ``lending'' him Alfie Moon's (Shane Richie) savings.

Shepherd expressed his excitement for forthcoming storylines for <bop>his<eop> character Michael and <bop>Wright<eop>'s character Jean.
False	Jennifer Jayne Jennifer Jayne (14 November 1931 -- 23 April 2006) was an English film and television actress born in Yorkshire to theatrical parents.

Marianne enters the room, slowly kisses <bop>Esther<eop>'s body on the lips, and drops a tear on <bop>her<eop> cheek.
False	While Harvey was one of the few female bounty hunters, what caught the attention of Shulman and Scott was that she was the daughter of the late actor Laurence Harvey.

Junior catches Boyd in the act. Denton is kidnapped by Junior's thugs and Junior reveals he has tortured and presumably killed Boyd. Denton's protests that <bop>he<eop> was uninvolved with Vassey's death are interrupted by the arrival of <bop>Scotty<eop>.
False	In November 2001, a month after the 11 September attacks, Mubarak al-Duri was contacted by Sudanese intelligence services who informed him that the FBI had sent Jack Cloonan and several other agents, to speak with a number of people known to have ties to Bin Laden. al-Duri and another Iraqi colleague agreed to meet with Cloonan in a safe house overseen by the intelligence service.

False	She is mentioned in the Steely Dan song ``Your Gold Teeth'' from the 1973 album Countdown to Ecstasy : ``Even Cathy Berberian knows / There's one roulade she can't sing.''

True	Their standard of craftsmanship has been virtually unchallenged until the late 20th Century British Craft Revival with makers such as John Makepeace and his lesser known apprentice Andrew Whateley demonstrating unrivalled craftsmanship.

True	During her second stint in Wentworth, Monica becomes involved in a couple of minor escapades (such as exploiting Deputy Governor Jim Fletcher's haemophobia with Bea), but for the most part tries to keep out of trouble in order to get her parole. Towards the end of <bop>her<eop> sentence, with Bea in solitary, <bop>Monica<eop> finds herself at odds with criminal mastermind Toni McNally (see separate entry), whom she refuses to bow down to, while Toni and henchman Martha suspect Monie of tipping off Vera with information about Toni's smuggling booze and drugs into the prison (although just how much Monica has told Vera, if anything, is never made overly clear).

On the other hand, one of the spirits that he has to deal with is revealed to be a high schoolmate, Chisato Ogawa, who has been admiring Madoka from the distance but cannot speak out until <bop>her<eop> death.
True	Also a guest was the Swedish feminist and activist Fredrika Bremer, who wrote in a letter to her sister Agathe: ``Late in the evening I sat in the most beautiful moonlight with <bop>Miss Dix<eop> on the veranda of General Stuarts' (sic) house, looking towards the shining river and the wide Chesapeake Bay, listening to the story of <bop>her<eop> simple yet remarkable life''.
True	Similar ideas are found in Dylan Thomas's ``Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night'', which Williams excerpted and added as an epigraph to his 1974 version. These lines are appropriate, as Thomas wrote the poem to his own dying father. Additionally, in one of <bop>his<eop> many drafts, in a footnote on Big Daddy's action in the third act, <bop>Williams<eop> deems Cat on a Hot Tin Roof a ``play which says only one affirmative thing about 'Man's Fate': that he has it still in his power not to squeal like a pig but to keep a tight mouth about it.''
True	Gibbons's approach to melody in both fantasias and dances features a capability for almost limitless development of simple musical ideas, on display in works such as Pavane in D minor and Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard.

True	DuMond's case received intense nationwide attention in late 2007, when his parole became an issue for presidential candidate Mike Huckabee during the 2008 presidential campaign.

False	Darcy finally decides that he needs a wife, and resolves to find a woman like Elizabeth Bennet from within his own social sphere, thus banishing any lingering feelings he has for her. To that end, he accepts the invitation of Lord Sayre, an old university friend for a week's stay at Sayre's family estate, Norwycke Castle, hoping to find a suitable wife amongst the party gathered there. Accompanied by <bop>his<eop> loyal valet <bop>Fletcher<eop>, he soon discovers that the members of the party he is joining are scheming, unscrupulous and not entirely what they seem, and that Sayre himself is a gambling addict who has almost gambled away his entire family estate.

In 1674 <bop>She<eop> was created Viscountess Bayning for life, and on her death in 1678 that title also became extinct.
True	Koehler has represented the Portugal Fed Cup team, where she has a singles win-loss record of 1--3 and a doubles win--loss record of 3--3 (4--6 overall). She is coached by former professional player Nuno Marques. Since her debut in October 2006 at the Braga satellite tournament, where she lost her first match 7--5, 6--1 to Catarina Ferreira, <bop>Koehler<eop> has mainly played in the ITF circuit. <bop>Her<eop> first attempt to qualify to a WTA Tour tournament came in May 2007 at the Estoril Open but she lost at the first qualifying round to Neha Uberoi 6--1, 6--0.

False	Speaking about Nick's re-introduction, Danson said it's interesting when an old character is re-introduced because even though it's a different actor, the previous baggage remains. Danson said that Nick has been involved with both Leanne and <bop>Maria<eop> and said obviously his family are there too so there is potential scope for that character. Danson said <bop>she<eop> does not know whether they will make anything of Leanne and him or not because she seems quite settled where she is.

He tells Roger he is staying with Sterling Cooper and promises that if he were to ever leave, it wouldn't be for another advertising job. This also ends Betty's aspirations to be a model, and as <bop>he<eop> turns down the job, Don tells <bop>Jim<eop> that hiring his wife was the wrong move.
False	Blanche (1309--1337), married to Infante Ramon Berenguer of Aragon, Count of Prades, son of James II of Aragon.

False	As Ruhnken's reputation spread, many efforts were made to attract him back to Germany, but after settling in Leiden, he only left the country once, when he spent a year in Paris, ransacking the public libraries (1755).

False	But operating within the minds of each is a set of epistemic practices that Troncoso deftly contrasts. When juxtaposed, the Nietzschean valor of Sanchez, the Christian pragmatism of Sassolini and the blind inductivism of Rosselli make for a sustained, intellectual tension that perfectly complements the narrative one. If Troncoso occasionally tips his hand, as <bop>he<eop> does when Helmut self-consciously asks ``What was morality anyway?'', or when the street-wise <bop>Rosselli<eop> puts forth a rather academic-sounding theory of racial division, the author is careful never to make the conflict between his characters' ``truths'' too explicit.

True	This image was the main reason why the producers initially refused to consider Cox for the part. Cox continued to lobby the studio as she felt she could believably play the character; her efforts ultimately succeeded. Actresses Melinda Clarke and Rebecca Gayheart auditioned for the role of Tatum Riley, before <bop>Rose McGowan<eop> was cast.

True	Janet Maslin of The New York Times thought the film missed the mark: ``Though the screenwriter and the director clearly share certain affinities, their collective efforts on Track 29, which opens today at the D. W. Griffith and Quad Cinema, amount to overkill, particularly since the direction is so laden with contempt for the characters... Though Mr. Roeg's films can often be perverse (and startlingly, bracingly so), they are rarely this silly. Nor are they this maddening, since Track 29 does contain the seeds of something tantalizing. <bop>Linda<eop>'s attempt to come to terms with <bop>her<eop> past through a wildly unpredictable, even dangerous fantasy has the stamp of Mr. Potter's better material, but it has been made too mindless to have any impact.

False	Over the course of Tales of Xillia 2, he serves as the arbiter of Origin's examination of human worth, but quickly shows himself to be extremely biased against humans, viewing them as greedy, warlike parasites.

False	This lasted until the November 30, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro, when Rhodes, who was guest refereeing a match between Barry Windham and Dean Malenko after being appointed by Eric Bischoff, defected back to WCW by disqualifying Windham and awarding the match to Malenko.

True	The poem begins in a descriptive rather than narrative manner, and it is not until the line ``When Lucy ceased to be'' that the reader is made aware that the subject of the verse has died. Literary scholar Mark Jones describes this effect as finding the poem is ``over before it has begun'', while according to writer Margaret Oliphant (1828--1897), <bop>Lucy<eop> ``is dead before we so much as heard of <bop>her<eop>''.

True	Michael G. Barilleaux of RapReviews.com said, ``For those who like a swell show of technical strength, a spin of this album will occupy your listen to and from the workplace quite well.

False	For this reason, Aiko is the bridge between the other four, acting as friend to Arashi, reassurance to Hajiki and Takumi, and a peacemaker to Katana. The latter two are the ones she is most in touch with, and has the greater impact on. It seems that no one can really dislike Aiko. Because <bop>she<eop> saved <bop>Sayuri<eop> from being crushed by Zero in a battle, Katana holds her in slight trust, and so she tries to bring him into their sort-of group by being friendly, visiting he and Sayuri in their hideout and bringing them lunches and snacks from time to time, to show her good faith and that she's concerned.
